Description:
This is just a collection of better dialogs for wxWidgets.  First is
wxBetterColourDialog which works like wxColourDialog but is much better 
than (in my opinion) even the windows color chooses.  There is also a 
wxBetterGradientDialog which allows easy editing of gradients.

At present only the source and header files are included.
