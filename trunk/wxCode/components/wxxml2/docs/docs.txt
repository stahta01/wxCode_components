\page dep wxXml2 dependencies

wxXml2 is a wrapper for libxml2 and thus it depends on libxml2 and all libxml2's dependencies, too.
Libxml2 depends on zlib and iconv. The first library is already built-in with wxWidgets so that there
are no problems with that. Iconv library instead needs to be compiled and linked together with
libxml2 and wxxml2.

\page installation wxXml2 installation

The wxXml2 wrappers are packed in a few source files and few header files,
 so you could think the best way to use them is to build the source files
 together with the sources of your app: in this case you should just add
 the source & header files to your project and compile them with the
 standard wxWidgets flags.

 Anyway, others may find a library more portable.
 To build a library, you can use the makefiles in the BUILD folder.
 They support all common flags (BUILD=release/debug, UNICODE=1/0 and so on...).

 Obviously these wrappers require the presence of the LIBXML2 library
 and, only on win32, of the ICONV library. These two libraries are cross-platform
 and can be compiled with various compilers. If you want to download the
 precompiled binaries for win32, I suggest you to download the LIBS package
 of the MathStudio project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mathstudio) which
 contains these two libraries compiled with MSVC, BORLAND and MINGW compilers.

 The most important thing you should do, specially if you've never used these classes
 before, is to build the sample and read its source file.
 The doxygen docs are a useful and detailed reference manual to use after you learnt
 how wxxml2 wrappers must be used.

 In particular, when building wxscript on an autoconf-based system (like Linux/GNU-based systems),
 you have to create the makefile doing:

  cd build
  aclocal
  autoconf
  ./configure [here you should use the same flags you used to configure wxWin]
  make
 
 Type "./configure --help" for more info.
 The autoconf-based systems also support a "make install" target which builds the library and then
 copies the headers of the component to /usr/local/include and the lib to /usr/local/lib.
