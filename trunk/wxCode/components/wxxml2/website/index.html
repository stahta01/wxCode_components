<h2>wxXml2</h2>


<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p> A simple set of classes, wxXml2Namespace, wxXml2Property, wxXml2Node, wxXml2DTD and
 wxXml2Document, that interfaces wxWidgets with libxml2.
 With this component you can add load/save/edit XML support to your wxWidgets application
 using all the power of a well-known library like libxml2.
 The full support for DTDs allows you to easily check your XML documents & thus to
 produce well-formed XML files.<br>

 By now, these classes wrap only the most important libxml2 features but they are
 perfectly integrated with wxWidgets and easily extensible since they provide good
 commented code & doxygen docs.</p><br>

<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Obviously, since wxXml2 is not an application but just a wrapper for the libxml2 library,
the following screenshots refers to the sample app included with this module which shows
how much easy is to get the tree structure of an XML doc through wxXml2 classes:</p><br>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The wxXml2 docs are generated through <A HREF="www.doxygen.org">doxygen</A>; you can access HTML version clicking <A HREF="docs/index.html">here</A>.</p><br>

<h3>Future enhancements</h3>
<p>Better Unicode support.</p>
