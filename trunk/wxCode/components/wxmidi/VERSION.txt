Version numbering
------------------

The versioning scheme of the wxMidi library is much like the standard
one used for Linux applications/libraries.

Version number is made of two numbers that represents:

- the major release
- the minor release

For example: '1.6' stands for:

 major: 1
 minor: 6

A change in the major release introduces an incompatibility between the library
and the applications that use it. In other words, when the major version changes,
the author has introduced a change in the API: it could be a change in some method
name or in the type and number of its parameters. Therefore, you will have
to review your application code and do some litle changes.

The minor release changes when something has been changed in the library (new classes
or new methods have been added to the library, or code has been changed for fixing bugs).
But the library remains compatible with the previous version. Therefore, you don't 
have to review your application code.

If your application has to compile differently depending on the wxMIDI
version you can know the actual version of the library by checking the
value of the following two macros that are defined in the header file
'src/wxMidi.h':

  - wxMIDI_MAJOR
  - wxMIDI_MINOR
