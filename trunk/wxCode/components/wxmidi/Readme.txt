description: 
    wxMidi is a MIDI interface based on PortMidi, the Portable 
    Real-Time MIDI Library. wxMidi offers a set of classes (wxMidiSystem, 
    wxMidiDevice, wxMidiMessage, wxMidiDatabaseGM and derived from them) that 
    interfaces wxWidgets with the PortMidi library. With this component you can add
    MIDI in/out commands support to your wxWidgets application. wxMidi provides a 
    suitable interface, object oriented, to use portmidi with wxWidgets, and all 
    strings has been moved from PortMidi and adapted to support 
    internationalization.
