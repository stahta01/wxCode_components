Changes between versions
--------------------------

wxMidi 2.0  (2015/Jan/12)
===========================

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH 1.5
	-----------------------------
	* Length of wxMidiSysExMessage uses now a 'long' instead of an 'int'. Therefore:
		- method wxMidiSysExMessage::Length() now returns a long.
		- method wxMidiSysExMessage::SetLength() now requires a long as parameter.
	  This change was required to avoid a limit of 32KB for SysEx messages.

	COMPATIBLE CHANGES
    -------------------
    * Fixed bug causing occasional problems when receiving sysex messages (thanks to
      Brian Walton for reporting this bug, tracing its origin and helping in tests).
	* Added code to detect and signal a timeout in the recepcion of SysEx messages. This
      could happend if midi cable is disconnected during a SysEx transmision.
    * Added optional parameter to wxMidiDeviceIn() constructor for specifying the wait
	  time (seconds) to finish an incomplete SysEx message before reporting a timeout
	  error. By default, 5 seconds. 
	* Added optional parameter to method wxMidiDeviceIn::Open() for specifying the buffer
	  size to be used by the portmidi library. Default value has been increased to 4KB.
	* Removed artificial limitation for receiving SysEx messages larger that 10,000 bytes.
      As a consequence, error code wxMIDI_ERROR_BadSysExMsg_Length has been removed.
    * Added two new translations: 
        - German, thanks to Undine Peters. 
        - Simplified Chinese, thanks to 卢文汐 (Wenxi Lu).
	* Documentation updated and rewriten for using Doxygen.
    * Minor changes in code, mainly for avoiding a couple of compilation warnings and for
      including documentation in source code.
    * Added more functionality to midisound sample application to allow to test
      more MIDI commands.


wxMidi 1.5  (2011/Dec/02)
===========================
    * Portmidi latest version (217) has changed the definition of PmTimestamp
      from 'long' to 'int'. This causes some compilation problems in wxMidi 
      that has been fixed. Code reviewed to ensure compatibility.
    * Fixed a couple of compilation errors due to changes introduced by
      wxWidgets 2.8.12
    * Added optional parameter to method wxMidiDatabaseGM::PopulateWithInstruments
      for optionally adding a sequence number to the listed items.
    * Added three new translations: Italian (Mauro Giubileo), Basque (Karlos 
      del Olmo Serna) and Galician (Emilio Mesías and Xema Sanxurxo 
      Rodríguez)
