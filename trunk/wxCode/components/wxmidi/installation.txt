 wxMidi component info
 ======================
 
 Component:  wxMidi
 Release:    1.0, pre-release
 Date:       03-Sep-2005
 wxWidgets:  2.4.x, 2.5.x, 2.6.x
 Maintainer: Cecilio Salmeron  /  s.cecilio@gmail.com
   
 Description:
 	wxMidi is a MIDI interface based on PortMidi, the Portable Real-Time MIDI Library, 
 	(PortMidi is available at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmidi/).
 
	wxMidi offers a set of classes: wxMidiSystem, wxMidiDevice, wxMidiMessage, 
	wxMidiDatabaseGM and derived from them, that interfaces wxWidgets with the PortMidi
	library. With this component you can add MIDI in/out support to your wxWidgets
	application.

	The main differences with PortMidi are:

	- wxMidi provides a suitable interface, object oriented, to use portmidi with wxWidgets.
 
	- All strings has been moved from PortMidi and adapted to support internationalization.
 
	- SysEx messages are not received in chunks with real-time messages interleaved. In wxMidi,
		sysex messages are received completed, in a single string of bytes, and any
		real-time message embeded is delivered before the sysex message is delivered.
 
	- All buffer allocation process for messages is now hiden in the wxMidi clases. User has
		not to worry abut this.

	- wxMidi also includes an additional feature, class wxMidiDatabaseGB, which provides methods
		for dealing with the General MIDI Standard (GM) instruments list. 


 	By now, these classes wrap only the most important PortMidi features but they are
 	perfectly integrated with wxWidgets and easily extensible since they provide good
 	commented code and documentation.

	wxMidi has been tested only in Windows.

 wxMidi 1.0 Installation
 ========================

 =============================================================================
 Step 1: INSTALL PORTMIDI    (For windows is already done. You can skip this step)
 =============================================================================


1)  For your convenience, the portmidi package is included in this download so it is not
    necessary to do download it. In case the portmidi package were not included or you
    would like to install an updated version, download portmidi.zip and 
    unzip it into directory: wxMidi\src\portmidi

2)  Compile package following the instructions in the package. Do not change
    the character set from Multibyte to Unicode. You will set this later in the
    wxMidi package.
    PORTMIDI MUST BE BUILT IN MULTIBYTE MODE, AND YOU MUST ENSURE THAT CONSTANT
    PM_CHECK_ERRORS IS NOT DEFINED IN THE PORTMIDI PROJECT (check that this definition
    is not included by in the predefined symbols list in the Settings dialog box).
    For Unicode versions, wxMidi takes care of converting portmidi strings to
    Unicode, so it is not necesary to build a Unicode version of portmidi libraries.

3)  After successful compilation, copy the libraries to the appropiate folder (\pm folder
    for release version, \pmd folder for debug version) in wxMidi\lib:

        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Release\pm_dll.dll    -->  wxMidi\lib\pm\pm_dll.dll
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Release\portmidi.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pm\portmidi.lib
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Release\porttime.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pm\porttime.lib

        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Debug\pm_dll.dll    -->  wxMidi\lib\pmd\pm_dll.dll
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Debug\portmidi.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pmd\portmidi.lib
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Debug\porttime.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pmd\porttime.lib

4)  Copy include file  portmidi\pm_common\portmidi.h  to  wxMidi\include


 =============================================================================
 Setp 2: COMPILE wxMidi    (For windows is already done. You can skip this step)
 =============================================================================

1)  Compile wxMidi. All makefiles and project are located in build\msw directory.
	After successful compilation you'll find the library in the subdirectory wxMidi\lib. 
	Name of the compiled library follow this scheme: name begin with "wxmidi" followed by
	version number and letters indicating if the library is compiled as Unicode ('u') 
	and/or debug build ('d'). Here are some examples:

		  lib\wxmidi10.lib	release library
		  lib\wxmidi10u.lib	release Unicode library
		  lib\wxmidi10d.lib	Debug library
		  lib\wxmidi10ud.lib	Debug Unicode library


2)  IMPORTANT! In Windows, portmidi needs the pm_dll.dll, but there is no simple way
    to set up projects to use this dll. Therefore, YOU MUST COPY this dll to your
    application executable file folder.



 =============================================================================
 Setp 3: COMPILE midisound SAMPLE TEST APPLICATION
 =============================================================================

For now, only project file for MS VC .NET 2003 !!

1)  Open project file in wxMidi\build\msw\midisound.sln  and build it.

2)  Copy pm_dll.dll from wxMidi\lib\pmd\pm_dll.dll to the application.exe folder.

3)  Run it. Good luck!




 Known bugs and problems
 ========================

 1. During the tests, the debugger has reported systematically a memory leak. The problem
	has been traced back to the portmidi package and has been reported to the portmidi maintainers.
	It is not a serious problem as the memory leak reported refers to some small fixed blocks of memory
	(about 20-40 bytes, one block per MIDI device in your machine) allocated on initialization
	that are not released at termination of the portmidi package. According to portmidi maintainers,
	it is not clear if the problem is a Windows problem or a portmidi problem, but it is going to
	be investigated.


 2. wxMidi has been developed and tested in Windows. Makefiles included in this distribution are only
	for MS Visual Studio 2003 .NET.  Sorry, but I do not have equipment/knowledge to give
	support for other compilers/platforms. Any help with this is welcome.
