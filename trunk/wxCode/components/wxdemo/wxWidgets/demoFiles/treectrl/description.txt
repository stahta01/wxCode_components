This sample demonstrates using the wxTreeCtrl class. Here you may see how to process various notification messages sent by this control and also when they occur (by looking at the messages in the text control in the bottom part of the frame).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adding, inserting and deleting items and branches from the tree as well as sorting (in default alphabetical order as well as in custom one) is demonstrated here as well - try the corresponding menu entries.
