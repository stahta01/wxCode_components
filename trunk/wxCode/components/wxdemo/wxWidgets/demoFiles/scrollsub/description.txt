This sample demonstrates use of the wxScrolledWindow class including placing subwindows into it and drawing simple graphics. It uses the SetTargetWindow method and thus the effect of scrolling does not show in the scrolled window itself, but in one of its subwindows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, this samples demonstrates how to optimize drawing operations in wxWidgets, in particular using the wxWindow::IsExposed method with the aim to prevent unnecessary drawing in the window and thus reducing or removing flicker on screen.
