This sample demonstrates use of the wxCheckListBox class intercepting check, select and double click events. It also tests use of various methods modifying the control, such as by deleting items from it or inserting new ones (these functions are actually implemented in the parent class wxListBox so the sample tests that class as well). The layout of the dialog is created using a wxBoxSizer demonstrating a simple dynamic layout.
