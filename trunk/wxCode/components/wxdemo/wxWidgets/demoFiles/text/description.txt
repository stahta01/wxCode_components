This sample demonstrates four features: firstly the use and many variants of the wxTextCtrl class (single line, multi line, read only, password, ignoring TAB, ignoring ENTER).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly it shows how to intercept a wxKeyEvent in both the raw form using the EVT_KEY_UP and EVT_KEY_DOWN macros and the higher level from using the EVT_CHAR macro. All characters will be logged in a log window at the bottom of the main window. By pressing some of the function keys, you can test some actions in the text ctrl as well as get statistics on the text ctrls, which is useful for testing if these statistics actually are correct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirdly, on platforms which support it, the sample will offer to copy text to the wxClipboard and to paste text from it. The GTK version will use the so called PRIMARY SELECTION, which is the pseudo clipboard under X and best known from pasting text to the XTerm program.
