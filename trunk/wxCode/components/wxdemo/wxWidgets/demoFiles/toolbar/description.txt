The toolbar sample shows the wxToolBar class in action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following things are demonstrated:&lt;br&gt;Creating the toolbar using wxToolBar::AddTool and wxToolBar::AddControl: see MyApp::InitToolbar in the sample.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using EVT_UPDATE_UI handler for automatically enabling/disabling toolbar buttons without having to explicitly call EnableTool. This is done in MyFrame::OnUpdateCopyAndCut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using wxToolBar::DeleteTool and wxToolBar::InsertTool to dynamically update the toolbar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some buttons in the main toolbar are check buttons, i.e. they stay checked when pressed. On the platforms which support it, the sample also adds a combobox to the toolbar showing how you can use arbitrary controls and not only buttons in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you toggle another toolbar in the sample (using Ctrl-A) you will also see the radio toolbar buttons in action: the first three buttons form a radio group, i.e. checking any of them automatically unchecks the previously checked one.
