This sample shows the wxDialUpManager class. In the status bar, it displays the information gathered through its interface: in particular, the current connection status (online or offline) and whether the connection is permanent (in which case a string 'LAN' appears in the third status bar field - but note that you may be on a LAN not connected to the Internet, in which case you will not see this) or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using the menu entries, you may also dial or hang up the line if you have a modem attached and (this only makes sense for Windows) list the available connections.
