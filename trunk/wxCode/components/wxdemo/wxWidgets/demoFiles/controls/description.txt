The controls sample is the main test program for most simple controls used in wxWidgets. The sample tests their basic functionality, events, placement, modification in terms of colour and font as well as the possibility to change the controls programmatically, such as adding an item to a list box etc. Apart from that, the sample uses a wxNotebook and tests most features of this special control (using bitmap in the tabs, using wxSizers and constraints within notebook pages, advancing pages programmatically and vetoing a page change by intercepting the wxNotebookEvent.
