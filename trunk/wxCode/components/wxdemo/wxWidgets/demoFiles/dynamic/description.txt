This sample is a very small sample that demonstrates use of the wxEvtHandler::Connect method. This method should be used whenever it is not known at compile time which control will receive which event or which controls are actually going to be in a dialog or frame. This is most typically the case for any scripting language that would work as a wrapper for wxWidgets or programs where forms or similar datagrams can be created by the users.
