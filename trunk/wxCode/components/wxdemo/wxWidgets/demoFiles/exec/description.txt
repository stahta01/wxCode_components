The exec sample demonstrates the wxExecute and wxShell functions. Both of them are used to execute the external programs and the sample shows how to do this synchronously (waiting until the program terminates) or asynchronously (notification will come later).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also shows how to capture the output of the child process in both synchronous and asynchronous cases and how to kill the processes with wxProcess::Kill and test for their existence with wxProcess::Exists.
