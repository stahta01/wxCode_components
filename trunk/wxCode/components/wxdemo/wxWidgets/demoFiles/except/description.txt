This very simple sample shows how to use C++ exceptions in wxWidgets programs, i.e. where to catch the exception which may be thrown by the program code. It doesn't do anything very exciting by itself, you need to study its code to understand what goes on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need to build the library with wxUSE_EXCEPTIONS being set to 1 and compile your code with C++ exceptions support to be able to build this sample.
