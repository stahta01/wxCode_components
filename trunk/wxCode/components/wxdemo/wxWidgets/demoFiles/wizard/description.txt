This sample shows the so-called wizard dialog (implemented using wxWizard and related classes). It shows almost all features supported:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Using bitmaps with the wizard and changing them depending on the page shown (notice that wxValidationPage in the sample has a different image from the other ones)&lt;br&gt;- Using TransferDataFromWindow to verify that the data entered is correct before passing to the next page (done in wxValidationPage which forces the user to check a checkbox before continuing).&lt;br&gt;- Using more elaborated techniques to allow returning to the previous page, but not continuing to the next one or vice versa (in wxRadioboxPage)&lt;br&gt;- This (wxRadioboxPage) page also shows how the page may process the Cancel button itself instead of relying on the wizard parent to do it.&lt;br&gt;- Normally, the order of the pages in the wizard is known at compile-time, but sometimes it depends on the user choices: wxCheckboxPage shows how to dynamically decide which page to display next (see also wxWizardPage)
