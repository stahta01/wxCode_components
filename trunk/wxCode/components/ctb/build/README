 Linux GCC compiliation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 Type 'make DEBUG=x GPIB=x' or 'make -f GNUmakefile DEBUG=x GPIB=x'

 You can also type: ./buildall.sh in the build folder to compile
 and link all variants (debug/release with and without gpib support)
 and install the headers and libs in the allocated space.
 Note! You must root, to do this, or just input:
 sudo ./buildall.sh

	
 Microsoft Visual C++ compilation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 Type 'nmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=x GPIB=x'

 To create all libs (debug/release with and without gpib support)
 just input: ./buildall.bat in the build folder.
	

 Borland C++ 5.0/5.5 compilation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 Type 'make -f makefile.bcc DEBUG=x GPIB=x'
 


 Watcom C++ 10.6/11 and OpenWatcom compilation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 Type 'wmake -f makefile.wat'


 Python support
 --------------

 Since version 0.9 ctb also includes a python module ctb.py.
 To build the python module by yourself, your system has to satisfy
 the following requirements:

 - the SWIG program, you get it at http://www.swig.org/ (for linux,
   take a look in your favorite distribution package manager).
   The current ctb module was build with SWIG version 1.3.29 (linux)
   and version 1.3.25 (Windows)
 - the develop files for python (means the header and the library
   files). I tested it with Python 2.3 and 2.4.
 - if you want to communicate via GPIB, a GPIB installation (GPIB 
   controller and software, for instance a Nation Instruments or 
   Keithley card). On Linux the libgpib.

 Like the building of the wxctb C++ library, you also can choose
 between GPIB and non GPIB (default) support.

 Compile the python module
 
 Linux
 cd in the python/src/linux folder and type:
 ./makepy.sh USE_GPIB
 or
 ./makepy.sh
 if you don't need any GPIB support

 Windows
 cd in the python/src/windows folder. Open the makepy.bat with your
 favorite editor and set the commented enviroment variables. See the
 makepy.bat file for more information, how you can do that.
 After that, just type:

 ./makepy.sh USE_GPIB
 (for GPIB support) or
 ./makepy.sh
 if you don't need any GPIB support

 At last set the python modul path to the wxctb-0.12/python/module
 path.
 On linux:

 export PYTHONPATH=somepath/wxctb-0.12/python/module/linux

 On Windows:

 set PYTHONPATH=drive:\somepath\wxctb-0.12\python\module\win32


 ChangeLog
 ---------
 0.13
     - remove the expect and match mechanism. They didn't work very
	  well, and a future implementation should be done as a
       independent library. If someone missed this functions, please
       let me know.

 0.12
     - more documentation for doxygen
	- replace the ugly GetSettingsAsString methods by a more intuitive
	  one.
     - wxGPIB::Read now checks the MAV bit before reading. This resolves
	  some stderr stuff on linux.

 0.11
     - the gpib sources are no longer depending on the OS. They are
	  identical for linux and windows.  
	- add the current version to the ctb include path, so you can
	  handle a parallel installation of different versions.
	  For instance: The header path wx/ctb is replaced by wx/ctb-0.11

 0.10
     - replace the former gpib async io access with the standard
	  NI-488 functions (ibrd,ibwrt). To avoid blocking, the internal
	  gpib timeout was set to the lowest value, whereas the wxIOBase
	  methods handles the timeout in a global and transparent manner.
	- add a FindListener method in the wxGPIB class to look for all
	  connected gpib devices (listeners).
     - The Read and Readv method of the python wxIOBase class returns
	  additional zero bytes, fixed. 

 0.9
	- added python support for both, serial and gpib 

 0.8
     - added bakefile support
	 
 0.7 
     - added GPIB (Nation Instruments GPIB cards) support
