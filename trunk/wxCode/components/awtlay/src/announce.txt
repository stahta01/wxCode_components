Subject: AWT layouts (contrib)

Hello all,

Sorry for bothering you with another contrib, as the release
is drawing closer, but here it came..

Uploaded source, makefiles, shot and win32-binary demo for 
this strange contrib. to:

http://soften.ktu.lt/~alex/awtlayouts/

the source contains C++ functional-equivalents for:

java.awt.BorderLayout
java.awt.FlowLayout
java.awt.CardLayout
java.awt.GridLayout
java.awt.GridBagLayout
javax.swing.BoxLayout    (a bit similar to wxBoxSizer)
AbsoluteLayout

(http://soften.ktu.lt/~alex/awtlayouts/overview.txt has more info)

The contrib i've written with a hope that it may appear useful/interesting
to users of wxWindows who are familiar with layouting system of AWT.

But the primary reason was - that i'm in a great need for a fast and *OSS-based*
GUI designer which generates layout-aware source for Java(TM). I'd have immediate
use of it at my job... therefor i'm thinking to rewrite my unfinished res-editor
(~alex/tmp1.gif) to use these wx-based C++ classes for visual editing of 
entirely layout-based dialogs/panels and generating Java source code for them.


Regards.
Aleksandras

PS: tip: If you'd suddenly felt like having half a day of truly intense 
    brainstorming (without writing a single line of code!), here's a great 
    recipe i found: get JDK docs, learn user-level description of 
    "java.awt.GridBagLayout" and "java.awt.GridBagConstraings" classes. 
    Then try to come up with reasonable (even not perfectly correct) alg. 
    for implementing the described requirements..... lots of fun!
