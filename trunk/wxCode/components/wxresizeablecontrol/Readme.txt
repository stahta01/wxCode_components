name: wxResizeableControl
author: Markus Greither
description: This wxWidgets based C++ class provides a user interface for child 
windows placed within other windows. The user can drag them around, and resize 
them using 8 marks drawn on each edge corner of the control. This class sends 
notification events to its parent when the window is created, resized, moved or 
deleted. There are derived classes for displaying pictures in bitmap or 
(WIN32 only) metafile formats.
