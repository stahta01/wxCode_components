Description:
A set of abstract classes to add a script-interpreter to your wxWidgets
applications/libraries.

The implementation of these interfaces for the Lua, UnderC and CINT interpreters are given.
The advantage of a single base interface allows the programmer who wants to use this
component to learn how to use a single set of powerful classes: wxLua, wxUnderC and wxCINT
all exposes the same functions adding to the program Lua & C++ script-interpreting
capabilities.
