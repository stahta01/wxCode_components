  xsProperty::FromString(const wxString& val) which sets the property value from its textual representation. The functions
  can be used for indirect manipulating with serialized data members encapsulated by properties (see xsSerializable::GetProperty()).

  by properties. See functions xsProperty::AsInt(), xsProperty::AsDouble(), etc.
- Function xsSerializable::AddChild(xsSerializable* child) correctly initializes all children recursively.

  using new defined operators.
- Added function bool xsSerializable::HasChildren().
- Added static function xsPropertyIO* wxXmlSerializer::GetPropertyIOHandler(const wxString& datatype) returning pointer to I/O handler suitable for given
  data type if exists, otherwise NULL.
- Added new data type and I/O handler for string hash map ('StringMap' data type).
- Defined operator "<<" in the wxXmlSerializer class which adds a serializable object on the right side to a static instance of wxXmlSerializer on the left
  side of the operator as a child object of serializer's root.
- Defined operator "<<" in the xsSerializable class which adds a serializable object on the right side to a static instace of xsSerializable on the left 
  side of the operator as its child object.
- Optimized xsPropertyIO::Write() function of array data types for speed.
- Declaration of xsProperyIO::ToString(T value) changed to xsProperyIO::ToString(const T& value).

- Updated premake build scripts to support CodeLite IDE.

Changes in version 1.1.9 beta (2009-01-01):

  xsSerializable::GetChildrenRecursively(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list, SEARCHMODE mode), where 'mode' parameter can be 'searchDFS' for Depth-First-Search
  or 'searchBFS' for Breadth-First-Search algorithm. The 'searchBFS' is default.
- Changed declaration of wxXmlSerializer::GetItems(wxClassInfo* type, SerializableList& list) function to wxXmlSerializer::GetItems(wxClassInfo* type, SerializableList& list,
  xsSerializable::SEARCHMODE mode = xsSerializable::searchBFS).

Changes in version 1.1.8 beta (2008-12-05):
------------------------------------------
- Improved detection of locales (decimal point).
- Alpha channel of wxColour data structure is serialized now.
- Improved deserialization speed of wxPoint and wxColour data structures.

Changes in version 1.1.7 beta (2008-10-05):
-------------------------------------------
- Function xsPropertyIO::AddPropertyNode() is now static and takes information about xml node type.
- Function xsSerializable::GetChild() now allows recursive search.
- IDs of managed serialized items are now serialized automatically by default (in previous library version this task had to be
  done explicitelly by a user).
- Fixed bug dealing with reading of float and double values on platforms which use ',' decimal character (fix no.2).

Changes in version 1.1.6 beta (2008-09-27):
-------------------------------------------
- Added support for new (exported) dynamic data containers (CharArray, IntArray, LongArray, DoubleArray).
- Fixed bug dealing with reading of float and double values on platforms which use ',' decimal character.

Changes in version 1.1.5 beta (2008-06-19):
-------------------------------------------
- Function xsSerializable::AddChild() returns pointer to the added child item. It also sets
  new unique ID to the added object if its previous ID was undefined (in the previous library
  version the ID was assigned by wxXmlSerializer::AddItem() function only).
- Added support for NaN and INF values for double and float data types (proposed by fantaz).
- Modified Sample1 code to demonstrate the ability to handle NaN and INF values.
- Name of function xsSerializable::GetChildren() changed to xsSerializable::GetChildrenList().
- Added function xsSerializable::GetChildren(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list) returning
  the child objects of given type (or all children if type is NULL).
- Added function xsSerializable::GetChildrenRecursively(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list) returning
  all child objects of given type recursively (or all children recursively if type is NULL).
- Function wxXmlSerializer::GetItems(wxClassInfo* type, SerializableList& list) doesn't return
  the number of found items anymore.
- Fixed crash in Sample4 on Linux.

Changes in version 1.1.4 beta (2008-02-08):
-------------------------------------------
- Decimal point in stored real values is always converted to character "." (locale settings are
  ignored). This change may cause some previously saved project unreadable (if your default decimal
  point character is set to ",").
- Suppressed compiler warnings dealing with unused variables (patch from fantaz).
- Added bakefiles-based build system. Also prebuilt makefiles for several platforms have beed 
  included into the release package.
- Source object references in the copy constructors are constant now.

Changes in version 1.1.3 beta (2008-01-17):
-------------------------------------------
- Updated code to use wxList::compatibility_iterator instead of pointers to wxNode class (so the
  STL lists are supported now).
- Each xsSerializable class instance added to the wxXmlSerializer container now knows its
  parent (functions xsSerializable::GetParentManager() and xsSerializable::SetParentManager() were added).
- Added new sample project (Sample4)
- Simplified older samples (why to do it in a complex way when it can be done in a simple way?:) )
  (please delete old saved XML configuration files).

Changes in version 1.1.2 beta (2007-12-21):
-------------------------------------------
- Instances of xsSerializable and wxXmlSerializer classes can be now cloned. This
  functionality is provided by special XS_DECLARE_CLONABLE_CLASS and XS_IMPLEMENT_CLONABLE_CLASS
  which must be used instead of classic macros DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLASS and IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CLASS
  in all derived classes which should be clonable. In this case the clonable class provides
  Clone() function which creates and returns a copy of the class instance done via its 
  copy constructor (it must be defined by the user).
- Added function wxXmlSerializer::CopyItems() which allow user to do full copy of given
  data manager (serializer). Note that stored content must be clonable (class instances must
  include the Clone() funtion (see the previous paragraph)). 
- Fixed possible memory leak in xsListRealPointPropIO data handler.

Changes in version 1.1.1 beta (2007-12-10):
-------------------------------------------
- Added wxChar support
- Fixed build of library samples on Linux
- Fixed build of "CustomDataSample" sample with MinGW compiler on MS Windows platform

-------------------------------------------
- Initial public release.
