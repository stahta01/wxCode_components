wxWidgets:  2.4.x, 2.5.x
Maintainer: Francesco Montorsi (frm)
Subdir:     keybinder

Description:
A generic system to bind one or more keyshortcut to the commands you want
(menu commands or whatever you like).
A pre-built panel and a complete system to view/remove/add/edit command
shortcuts is included. Also key profiles are supported and a complete
load/save system based on wxConfig is present.
Integrates with your applications with few modifications and allows the
users to customize all the commands he wants, bypassing the limitation of a
single keybind to each command.



 Installation
 ------------

 -> on Win32 with wxMSW:
    Go into the BUILD folder of the keybinder; there you will find the makefiles
    for MSVC (nmake), BORLAND, WATCOM and MINGW compilers...

 -> on Linux with wxX11/wxGTK:
    use the Makefile placed in the main folder to compile both the sample & the lib.
