Description:
A generic system to bind one or more keyshortcuts to the commands you want
(menu commands or whatever you like).
A pre-built panel and a complete system for viewing/remove/add/edit command
shortcuts is included.
Integrates with your applications with few modifications and allows the
users to customize all the commands he wants, bypassing the limitation of a
single keybind to each command.




 Installation
 ------------

 -> on Win32 with wxMSW:
    use the MSVC++ project file to compile the sample & (eventually) the lib (if you need it).

 -> on Linux with wxX11/wxGTK:
    use the Makefile placed in the main folder to compile both the sample & the lib.
