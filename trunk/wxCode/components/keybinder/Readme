Description:
A generic system to bind one or more keyshortcuts to the commands you want
(menu commands or whatever you like).

A pre-built panel and a complete system for viewing/remove/add/edit command
shortcuts is included.

Integrates with your applications with few modifications and allows the
users to customize all the commands he wants, bypassing the limitation of a
single keybind to each command.
