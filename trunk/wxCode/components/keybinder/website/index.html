<h2>Keybinder</h2>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>A generic system to bind one or more keyshortcut to the commands you want
(menu commands or whatever you like).
A pre-built panel and a complete system to view/remove/add/edit command
shortcuts is included. Also key profiles are supported and a complete
load/save system based on wxConfig is present.
Integrates with your applications with few modifications and allows the
users to customize all the commands he wants, bypassing the limitation of a
single keybind to each command.</p>

<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Obviously, since keybinder is not an application, the following screenshot
refers to the sample app included with this module which shows the usage
of the keybinder classes:</p><br>

<h3>Future enhancements</h3>
