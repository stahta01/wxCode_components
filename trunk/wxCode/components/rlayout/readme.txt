Intro:
------
wxRlLayout is a window layout manager for top-level windows, child windows, 
panels and dialogs. It does not enforce a central 'document' area. Support 
for window panes, toolbars, dragging panes & toolbars, floating and docking, 
saving/loading layouts (aka perspectives). It uses wxSizers for the entire layout so it is flexible 
in terms of what layouts it permits. It also provides a light-weight class 
for drawing customized window/tool decorations and borders.


Version:
--------
0.5, running since some months on Linux & Win32


Requirement:
------------
Requires wxWidgets >-2.8.4
Tested with wxMSW and wxGTK.
It does not use any platform specific features so it should be 
straight forward to build for other platforms. If you do, please
inform me.
