 Description:
	wxActiveRecordGenerator (aka wxARG) is an application that will let you conect to a database (currently supported: SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL), select a table and it's relations with others (currently: has-many relation) and will generate a code which you can use to access directly to the data without the need of the SQL language (althought you can still use it if you want/need to).

 Instructions:
 -------------
	Play around with the program. All you need to use the generated classes is to include them in your project. Include also the wxActiveRecord.h and wxActiveRecord.cpp files and have a working DatabaseLayer backends (currently supported: SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL). You can choose what backend to use comenting out the defines at the begging of the wxActiveRecord.h file.

 Examples:
 
   > nmake -fmakefile.vc WX_DIR=c:\path\to\my\wxWidgets WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1
   > make -fmakefile.bcc WX_DIR=c:\path\to\my\wxWidgets WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1
