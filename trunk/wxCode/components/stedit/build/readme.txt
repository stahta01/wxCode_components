This document describes how to build wxStEdit using gcc, mingw, Microsoft
Visual Studio, and a variety of other compilers. Please see the section 
appropriate for your compiler to learn how to build the wxStEdit library
and sample executable.

You must have a working copy of a development library of wxWidgets before
proceding. This means that you have either shared (.so in Linux, .dll in MSW)
or static (.a in Linux, .lib in MSW) libraries and the headers for them.

NOTE: You must always use the same ANSI/Unicode settings to build wxStEdit
as your development build of wxWidgets.

MSW NOTE: You must always use the same Debug/Release settings to build 
wxStEdit as your development build of wxWidgets. Otherwise you will have
strange linking errors/warnings about using /NODEFAULTLIB:MSVCRT(D).lib

=============================================================================
= GCC/GMake compatible Makefiles using the wx-config script (Linux, Mingw)
=============================================================================

Requirements: GCC, GMake, and wx-config script from a wxWidgets devel library
Platforms   : Unix, Cygwin, or using Mingw in MSW
Build Types : Identical settings as your wxWidgets lib since all settings
              are taken from the wx-config script in your path

These Makefiles are easy to understand, use, customize on the command line, 
or modify. The wx-config script should have been generated by a successful 
wxWidgets build or is provided in the devel wxWidgets library package that 
you should be able to install from your Linux distributer.

Please test that your wx-config script is in your path by running:
$ wx-config --help
$ wx-config --prefix  # this will tell you what wxWidgets it uses

These are the Makefiles: (read them to see the available targets)

Makefile.wx-config       # The 'all' target calls the two Makefiles below
src/Makefile             # Builds static/shared libwxcode_gtk2ud_stedit-X.Y.a
                         # and .so libs in the lib/ directory.
/samples/stedit/Makefile # Build the sample editor linking to above libs in the
                         # samples/stedit/ directory

Run these Makefiles in the directory where they exist.                
                         
You can override where the wx-config script is located, if it is not in your
path or you wish to use an alternate wxWidgets build, by running:

$ make -f Makefile.wx-config WXCONFIG=/path/to/wxWidgets/.../wx-config

=============================================================================
= CMake
=============================================================================

Get and install CMake >= 2.8.6 then create a new directory for the build 
to go in. Don't try to use the root of the wxStEdit source tree. 

To see what options are availble run;

$ cmake /path/to/wxstedit
