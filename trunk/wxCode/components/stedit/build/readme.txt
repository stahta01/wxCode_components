= GCC/GMake compatible Makefiles using the wx-config script (Linux, Mingw)
=============================================================================

Requirements: GCC, GMake, and wx-config script from a wxWidgets devel library
Platforms   : Unix, Cygwin, or using Mingw in MSW
Build Types : Identical settings as your wxWidgets lib since all settings
              are taken from the wx-config script in your path

These Makefiles are easy to understand, use, customize on the command line, 
or modify. The wx-config script should have been generated by a successful 
wxWidgets build or is provided in the devel wxWidgets library package that 
you should be able to install from your Linux distributer.

These are the Makefiles: (read them to see the available targets)

Makefile.wx-config       # The 'all' target calls the two Makefiles below
src/Makefile             # Builds static/shared libwxcode_gtk2ud_stedit-X.Y.a
                         # and .so libs in the lib/ directory.
/samples/stedit/Makefile # Build the sample editor linking to above libs in the
                         # samples/stedit/ directory

You can override where the wx-config script is located, if it is not in your
path or you wish to use an alternate wxWidgets build, by running:

$ make -f Makefile.wx-config WXCONFIG=/path/to/wxWidgets/.../wx-config

=============================================================================
= Bakefile generated build files
=============================================================================

Requirements: Compilers MSVC, BCC, Watcom, or GCC
Platforms   : MSW, Unix, Cygwin, or using Mingw in MSW
Build Types : The project files have a variety of pre-made configurations. 
              The Makefile options allow you to specify one to match your 
              wxWidgets build

These build files are generated by the wxstedit.bkl file by Bakefile. They are
compatible with most wxWidgets library builds and support the widest variety 
of compilers. They target wxWidgets 2.8.

The files created by Bakefile are:
    ../Makefile.in      # Makefile for configure script
    autoconf_inc.m4     # m4 file for aclocal used to generate configure script
    GNUmakefile         # make -f GNUMakefile (for Unix systems)
    makefile.bcc        # Borland C++ compiler
    makefile.gcc        # make -f makefile.gcc (for mingw on MSW)
    makefile.vc         # nmake -f makefile.vc (for Visual Studio nmake.exe)
    makefile.wat        # Watcom makefile
    wxstedit_vc2003.sln             # Visual Studio 2003 solution
    wxstedit_vc2003_stedit.vcproj   
    wxstedit_vc2003_wxstedit.vcproj 
    wxstedit_vc2005.sln             # Visual Studio 2005 solution
    wxstedit_vc2005_stedit.vcproj
    wxstedit_vc2005_wxstedit.vcproj
    wxstedit_vc2008.sln             # Visual Studio 2008 solution
    wxstedit_vc2008_stedit.vcproj
    wxstedit_vc2008_wxstedit.vcproj
    wxstedit_vc6.dsw                # Visual Studio 6 workspace
    wxstedit_vc6_stedit.dsp
    wxstedit_vc6_wxstedit.dsp

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GNUMakefile and the makefile.bcc/gcc/vc/wat files have their options at the
top. Please view the file to understand how to configure these Makefiles to
match your build of wxWidgets. 
For example: 
    $nmake -f makefile.vc WX_SHARED=0 WX_UNICODE=0 WX_DEBUG=0 SHARED=0
Builds a static stedit lib and links to a static, ANSI, release wxWidgets lib.

Before running the Visual Studio nmake.exe program in a DOS prompt you must 
first run vcvars32.bat which for MSVS2008 is installed by default to this dir.
c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 2008\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Visual Studio projects are fairly straightforward. You must set the
environment variable WXWIN=c:\path\to\wxWidgets before starting MSVS.
Then open the .sln or .dsw appropriate for the version of MSVS you have 
and select the desired build type that matches what you have already built 
in the WXWIN dir.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The files for bakefile are:
    Bakefile.bkgen # edit to point to wxstedit.bkl, bakefile_gen reads this
    wxstedit.bkl   # main bakefile 
    configure.ac   # copied from wxCode/build/autoconf and edit version at least
    config.sub     # copied from wxCode/build/autoconf
    config.guess   # copied from wxCode/build/autoconf
    install.sh     # copied from wxCode/build/autoconf
    acregen.sh     # copied from wxCode/build/autoconf

Minimal Bakefile version is 0.2.9.

Rerun bakefile_gen in the stedit/build directory to recreate the make/project 
    files in a Bash or DOS prompt. Note: cygwin shell doesn't work properly.
    e.g. "c:\Program Files\Bakefile\src\bakefile_gen"

To do a full rebuild you need to run bakefile_gen in Linux so you can also
   run acregen.sh.

   To be sure that the correct *.m4 files are used when you run aclocal.
   $acregen.sh "--acdir=/path/to/new/bakefile-x.y.z/share/aclocal"

   NOTE: If you are using the system bakefile then you may simply call the
   acregen.sh script which calls aclocal && autoconf && mv configure ..
