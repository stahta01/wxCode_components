The minimal files for bakefile are:
    Bakefile.bkgen # edit to point to wxstedit.bkl

    configure.ac  # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf and edit
    config.sub    # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf
    config.guess  # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf
    install.sh    # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf
    acregen.sh    # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf

You supply this file
    wxstedit.bkl

The remaining files are generated by bakefile except for the
    MS Visual Studio *.dsw workspace file which is written by hand.

Create make/project files in MSW DOS prompt using:
    Note: cygwin shell doesn't work properly.
    "c:\Program Files\Bakefile\src\bakefile_gen"
