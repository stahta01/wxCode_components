The minimal files for bakefile are:
    Bakefile.bkgen # edit to point to wxstedit.bkl, bakefile_gen reads this

    configure.ac  # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf and edit version at least
    config.sub    # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf
    config.guess  # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf
    install.sh    # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf
    acregen.sh    # copy from wxCode/build/autoconf

You supply this file
    wxstedit.bkl

The remaining files are generated by bakefile except for the
    MS Visual Studio *.dsw workspace file which is written by hand.

Create make/project files in MSW DOS prompt using:
    Note: cygwin shell doesn't work properly.
    "c:\Program Files\Bakefile\src\bakefile_gen"

To do a full rebuild you need to run bakefile_gen in Linux so you can also
   run acregen.sh.

   If you have compiled a newer version of bakefile than
   an installed package of it you can run it as:
   $/path/to/new/bakefilex.y.z/bin/bakefile_gen

   To be sure that the correct *.m4 files are used when you run aclocal.
   $acregen.sh "--acdir=/path/to/new/bakefile-x.y.z/share/aclocal"

   NOTE: If you are using the system bakefile then you may simply call the
   acregen.sh script which calls aclocal && autoconf && mv configure ..
