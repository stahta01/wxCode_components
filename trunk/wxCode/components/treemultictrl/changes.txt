	v1.09
	- Ok my secomd attempt with Bakefile. Cmake is great, but it annoys me that the FindWxWin.cmake script still sucks bigtime
	- The bakefile seems to work fine now, it is the only addition. Now wxWin 2.6.0 - 2.4.2 is properly supported

    v1.08 - 
    - Tried Bakefile for this project, but due to it's 'incompleteness' towards user projects I had to use CMake again.
    - I also altered the FindWxWin.CMAKE file so seperate libraries can be used instead of monolithic 
    - Fixed a local redraw bug (category: Bug) (completed: 4/30/2005)
    - IsExpanded argument removed (category: Bug) (completed: 4/30/2005)
    - Added new Panther OSX icons (completed: 4/30/2005) thanks to David Wright
    - 0000093: [Documentation] Added doxygen generation in CMake script (jorgb)
               Set USE_DOXYGEN to YES in CMake to get documentation on the fly (or check it from the site)
    - 0000048: [Improvements] Allow a checkboxes and radioboxes at any level (jorgb)
               If you don't wish checkbox functionality (remember this is a toggle so not all items automatically get a 
               checkbox) simply set USE_CHECKBOXVIEW in CMake to NO. This will exclude this functionality in the compile
               process (saves about 15k). I made this a compiler option because extra 3 icon bitmaps are included in the build.
    - 0000077: [GUI behaviour] Upon clicking the checkbox is not redrawn properly (jorgb)
    - 0000081: [Development] Upon checking the TreeMultiItemNode, the underlying items should be all checked or cleared (jorgb)
    - 0000072: [GUI behaviour] Optimize performance on redrawing of the nodes (jorgb)
    - 0000049: [wxWidgets Distrib Problems] Arranged the source so it matches the Contrib directory of wxWidgets (jorgb)
               If wxWidgets wants to put it in the contrib, I won't stop them.
    - 0000047: [Improvements] Add a new way how to allow controls at the caption level (jorgb)
               This is a patch which can be found at: http://solidsteel.nl/bugs/view.php?id=47 although I strongly advice
               against it. I do not offer support on bugs when this patch is applied, because I haven't been able to test
               it thoroughly, and it seems to disrupt the intended object model.

	v1.07 - This is an intermediate version, where the only things that changed are the use of CMake as primary make
			file generator. I have decided to use this, because of the ever cumbersome job of keeping makefiles consistent
			under Linux, MacOS, HP-UX, and under windows, maintaining VS6 and VS7 as projects. Now that the current makefiles
			give problems under HP-UX, CMakifying the project files should solve a lot of x-platform issues. Please consult
			README for build information.

	v1.06 - Fixed a bug where calling GetSize() before creation would return garbage in wxWidgets 2.4.2. Also centered the
			collapse / expand icons when a custom font would be applied with SetCaptionFont. Also fixed a small error where
			the calculated width of the tree nodes with a custom font would be wrong and based on default font.

June 09, 2004
	v1.05 - Changed project for the test sample to run on wxWidgets 2.5.2. The big library that was used in 
	        wxWidgets 2.5.1 and down, doesn't compile nomore for 2.5.2 so I decided it was time to advance to the
	        new library way. If you need the old library settings, simple delete the new libs, and add the old 
	        wxmsw lib in visual studio.

	v1.05 - Fixed a small bug in 2.4.2. It is not allowed to use a wxPaintDC outside an OnPaint event. I needed a DC
	        for the client font, so I used a wxClientDC. Thanks to Aron Pongo for pointing it out!
	        
	      - Fixed a two step creation bug. When using in a XRC the proper create is not called. This was reported by 
	        Gregory Jaegy. 

May 28, 2004 
	v1.04 - Added methods to change the caption font. Per default it is the same as the standard DC font under windows, but
	        using SetCaptionFont and GetCaptionFont the font can be changed. Be aware that SetCaptionFont is a global caption
	        font modifier. It does not change the font of the window controls added. This was added to allow bold faced 
	        captions under some OS'es.
	
	      - The icons for the collapsing and expanding nodes are now different under various OS'es. For Mac I created (simple)
	        triangles, the Linux version are close to what linux uses as a standard as well. Any other OS will get the default
	        Windows XP look icons. For Mac I am still looking for better gfx.

	v1.03 - Compiles now under wxWidgets 2.5.1., wxGTK 2.5.1 still untested. There was a problem with wxArray::Remove 
	        so I used wxArray::Detach instead
