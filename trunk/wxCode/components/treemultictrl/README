Welcome to wxTreeMultiCtrl - A wxWidgets control that allows wxWindow controls to be shaped in a tree, 
                             with folding capabilities, like a scrollable property sheet.

Current wxTreeMultiCtrl version is v1.08

FIXED AND NEW FEATURES 
----------------------

Jul 21, 2005
	v1.09
	- Ok my secomd attempt with Bakefile. Cmake is great, but it annoys me that the FindWxWin.cmake script still sucks bigtime
	- The bakefile seems to work fine now for debug, it is the only addition. Now wxWin 2.6.0 - 2.4.2 is properly supported

    v1.08 - 
    - Tried Bakefile for this project, but due to it's 'incompleteness' towards user projects I had to use CMake again.
    - I also altered the FindWxWin.CMAKE file so seperate libraries can be used instead of monolithic 
    - Fixed a local redraw bug (category: Bug) (completed: 4/30/2005)
    - IsExpanded argument removed (category: Bug) (completed: 4/30/2005)
    - Added new Panther OSX icons (completed: 4/30/2005) thanks to David Wright
    - 0000093: [Documentation] Added doxygen generation in CMake script (jorgb)
               Set USE_DOXYGEN to YES in CMake to get documentation on the fly (or check it from the site)
    - 0000048: [Improvements] Allow a checkboxes and radioboxes at any level (jorgb)
               If you don't wish checkbox functionality (remember this is a toggle so not all items automatically get a 
               checkbox) simply set USE_CHECKBOXVIEW in CMake to NO. This will exclude this functionality in the compile
               process (saves about 15k). I made this a compiler option because extra 3 icon bitmaps are included in the build.
    - 0000077: [GUI behaviour] Upon clicking the checkbox is not redrawn properly (jorgb)
    - 0000081: [Development] Upon checking the TreeMultiItemNode, the underlying items should be all checked or cleared (jorgb)
    - 0000072: [GUI behaviour] Optimize performance on redrawing of the nodes (jorgb)
    - 0000049: [wxWidgets Distrib Problems] Arranged the source so it matches the Contrib directory of wxWidgets (jorgb)
               If wxWidgets wants to put it in the contrib, I won't stop them.
    - 0000047: [Improvements] Add a new way how to allow controls at the caption level (jorgb)
               This is a patch which can be found at: http://solidsteel.nl/bugs/view.php?id=47 although I strongly advice
               against it. I do not offer support on bugs when this patch is applied, because I haven't been able to test
               it thoroughly, and it seems to disrupt the intended object model.

HOW TO BUILD
------------

Bakefile is now used for the build generation. You should (in practice) not need to rebuild the files. Please go to the 
build directory and select the project file of your choice.

Please do not forget to set the WXWIN environment var under Windows. This points to the root dir of wxWidgets, eg.

	WXWIN=Z:\wxWidgets\wx2.6.1\

AFTER you set it, then start up any Visual Studio projects or else the env var is not yet in memory.

If you do need to rebuild the makefiles / projects.. 

    1) Download and install Bakefile (http://bakefile.sourceforge.net)
    2) Under Windows the build/Bakefiles.bkgen will work out of the box (set the WXWIN env var though)
	   Under Linux please change the %WXWIN% include setting for an include setting where wxWidgets presets are found
	3) run bakefile_gen and it should regenerate the projects, if needed switch on your projects in Bakefiles.bkgen
