Component: wxTreeMultiCtrl
Maintainer : Jorgen Bodde

Description:
A tree control that can contain other controls, like a tree shaped property 
sheet. The wxTreeMultiCtrl is loosely based upon the wxTreeCtrl and contains 
the same basic interface. However, the underlying functionality is a complete 
rewrite, to allow wxWindow derived classes to be painted in a tree shaped 
structure.

Changelog:
- Contains proper CMake files again
