wxFormatValidator
=================

CHANGES

2.0   Apr 2012
---
* A deep revision of code has fixed some issues and allowed more features.
* Use wxTextEntry (from wx29) and using this validator with wxComboBox is now allowed.
* valnum.x renamed to fvalnum.x to avoid same names as wx29 ones.
* Added '*' for style, meaning 'all remaining digits'. It adds this feature in exponential
  part. It replaces '#' meaning in decimal part. Please, update your code.
* Max and Min values are now C-locale strings, not formatted. Please, update your code.
* Max and Min values can force (limit) value to them.
* CkeckMinMax() allows any human represented number (i.e. a 100-digits one).
* CkeckMinMax() allows also excluded range, not only included one.
* SetFormatted() acepts a parameter with the type of format to do.
* Added Scientific and Engineering notations.
* Added rounding off option.
* Added a special style for validating while typing.
* Added wxVAL_RETAIN_FOCUS flag. Now, wxVAL_ON_KILL_FOCUS flag does validation, but does
  not retain focus on error.
* Added wxVAL_NO_MSG_SHOWN flag, to avoid showing error messages.
* Added RestoreWithEsc(). It defines if 'Esc' key is used to discard changes.
* Added SetAlsoValid() wich allow other values (not needed to be a number) as valid.
* Added SetColors() for colouring the control.
* Added SetEmptyAs() for telling what to do with an empty value.
* Added ValidateQuiet() with works without showing an error message.
* Added MsgOrSound() to show the error message.
