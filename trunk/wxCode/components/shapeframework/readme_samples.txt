Sample projects' description:
-----------------------------

./samples/wxSFSample1 - this sample project demostrates basic wxSF functionality. It shows
		how to create the diagram manager associated with the shape canvas,
		how to set their basic properties and define their behaviour. It also
		demostrates how to add simple shape to the canvas (manager). Events
		generated by the user or produced by the framework are handled via
		standar wx event system.

./samples/wxSFSample2 - this sample project demostrates basic wxSF functionality. It shows
		how to create the diagram manager associated with the shape canvas,
		how to set their basic properties and define their behaviour. It also
		demostrates how to add simple shape to the canvas (manager). Events
		generated by the user or produced by the framework are handled by
		virtual functions encapsulated by a class derived from the wxSFShapeCanvas
		base class.

./samples/wxSFSample3 - this sample project demostrates advanced wxSF functionality. It shows
		how to create the diagram manager associated with the shape canvas,
		how to set their basic properties and define their behaviour. It also
		demostrates how to add more complex composite shapes into diagram
		manager and how to serialize/deserialize the diagram to XML file. Events
		generated by the user or produced by the framework are handled via
		standar wx event system.

./samples/wxSFSample4 - this sample project demostrates how to use wxSFControlShape for managing
		of assigned GUI controls. The wxSFControlShape allows user to move and resize
		the GUI controls around the shape canvas. GUI events can be processed both by
		the shape canvas and the widget itself.

./samples/wxSFDemo - the most complex sample demonstrating lots of wxSF's functionality
		including complex diagram creation, the clipboard operations, undo/redo, 
		serialization, graphics export, and more.
