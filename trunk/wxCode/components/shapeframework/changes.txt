- Fixed update of grid shapes.
- Fixed incorrect update of grid cell IDs at deserialization.
- Added new function wxSFGridShape::RemoveFromGrid(long id).

Changes in version 1.9.1 beta (2010-01-15):

  still available.
- Updated wxSFSample1 and wxSFSample2 sample projects to demonstrate new library's functionality.
- Slightly tuned sensivity for searching of a line under the cursor.
- Fixed function wxSFDiagramManager::GetAssignedConnections(); shapes with ID equal to -1 will not be examined.

    xsProperty::FromString(const wxString& val) which sets the property value from its textual representation. The functions
    can be used for indirect manipulating with serialized data members encapsulated by properties (see xsSerializable::GetProperty()).
  - Added set of type cast functions with data type assertion for indirect manipulation with serialized data members encapsulated
    by properties. See functions xsProperty::AsInt(), xsProperty::AsDouble(), etc.
  - Function xsSerializable::AddChild(xsSerializable* child) correctly initializes all children recursively.
  - Function wxXmlSerializer::SetRootItem(xsSerializable* root) correctly initializes all root's children recursively.

  shape will be located in its center.
  calling its equivalent in a diagram manager class.
- Renamed function wxSFShapeBase::IsInside(const wxPoint& pos) to wxSFShapeBase::Contains(const wxPoint& pos) due to
  its previous misleading name.

    data type if exists, otherwise NULL.
  - Added new data type and I/O handler for string hash map ('StringMap' data type).
  - Defined operator "<<" in the wxXmlSerializer class which adds a serializable object on the right side to a static instance of wxXmlSerializer on the left
    side of the operator as a child object of serializer's root.
  - Defined operator "<<" in the xsSerializable class which adds a serializable object on the right side to a static instace of xsSerializable on the left 
    side of the operator as its child object.
  - Optimized xsPropertyIO::Write() function of array data types for speed.
  - Declaration of xsProperyIO::ToString(T value) changed to xsProperyIO::ToString(const T& value).

  wxSFEditTextShape::GetEditType() along with style wxSFEditTextShape::EDITTYPE (values editINPLACE and editDIALOG are available
  for now).
- Pressing of the ENTER key when editable text (wxSFEditTextShape) is modified causes termination of editing process.
  Pressing of the ENTER key together with the SHIFT key will add a newline to the edited text (all applicable only in in-place edit mode).

Changes in version 1.7.1 beta (2008-12-20):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer 1.1.9:
  - Added functions xsSerializable::GetFirstChild(wxClassInfo *type), xsSerializable::GetLastChild(wxClassInfo *type), xsSerializable::GetSibbling(wxClassInfo *type).
  - Changed declaration of xsSerializable::GetChildrenRecursively(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list) function to
    xsSerializable::GetChildrenRecursively(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list, SEARCHMODE mode), where 'mode' parameter can be 'searchDFS' for Depth-First-Search
    or 'searchBFS' for Breadth-First-Search algorithm. The 'searchBFS' is default.
  - Changed declaration of wxXmlSerializer::GetItems(wxClassInfo* type, SerializableList& list) function to wxXmlSerializer::GetItems(wxClassInfo* type, SerializableList& list,
    xsSerializable::SEARCHMODE mode = xsSerializable::searchBFS).

- Significant speed improvements and optimizations in shape canvas and diagram manager. These improvements required some small
  API changes; see the lines bellow for more information.
- Changed declaration of wxSFDiagramManager::GetShapes(ShapeList& shapes) function to wxSFDiagramManager::GetShapes(wxClassInfo* shapeInfo, ShapeList& shapes 
  xsSerializable::SEARCHMODE mode = xsSerializable::searchBFS).
- Changed declaration of wxSFShapeBase::GetChildShapes(ShapeList& children, bool recursive = false) to wxSFShapeBase::GetChildShapes(wxClassInfo *type, ShapeList& children,
  bool recursive = false, xsSerializable::SEARCHMODE mode = xsSerializable::searchBFS).
- Functions wxSFDiagramManager::GetAssignedConnections, wxSFDiagramManager::GetShapes, wxSFDiagramManager::GetShapesAtPosition,
  wxSFDiagramManager::GetShapesInside and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetSelectedShapes don't return number of found elements anymore
  ( user can call wxList::GetCount() function later if neccessary ).
- Line shapes connected to child shapes are moved together with their parent if dragged or moved by keys.
- Fixed propagation of some key events to shapes (arrow keys on lines weren't processed correctly).
- Fixed possible crash if parent shape was dropped (in some special cases) to its child shape.

Changes in version 1.7.0 beta (2008-12-05):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer 1.1.8:
  - Improved detection of locales (decimal point).
  - Alpha channel of wxColour data structure is serialized now.
  - Improved deserialization speed of wxPoint and wxColour data structures.

- Added experimental support for wxGraphicsContext. The feature can be activated via static function wxSFShapeCanvas::EnableGC().
  If enabled then new wxWidgets renderer class is used by wxSFScaledDC class so the shapes are antialiazed, support semitransparency via
  colour aplha channel and support alpha channel in images. This feature can be used only if both wxSF and wxWidgets
  libraries are compiler with wxUSE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=1. Note that only subset of drawing functions declared in wxDC class are
  currently redirected to use wxGraphicsContext (rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, line, point, polygon, polypolygon, text and bitmap). 
- wxSFScaledPaintDC class was replaced by wxSFScaledDC class derived directly from wxDC class which is used as a wrapper for any other DC.
  This modification allowed the library to use wxGraphicsContext together with all other DCs (paint, memory, print, ...).
- Added shape's alignment flags valignEXPAND and halignEXPAND.
- Shapes assigned to a grid shape are now aligned inside the grid cells in accordance to the shapes' current alignment flags.
- Improved line and curve shapes' drawing speed.
- New shapes created by wxSFDiagramManager::AddShape(wxClassInfo* shapeInfo, const wxPoint& pos, bool saveState) function
  are assigned to an underlying shape (if exists) as its child automatically.
- Added function wxSFShapeBase::IsInside(const wxRect& rct) returning TRUE if a shape is completely inside given rectangle.
- Functions GetShapeAtPosition(), GetShapesAtPosition() and GetShapesInside() are now members of wxSFDiagramManager class. Their
  previous implementation in wxSFShapeCanvas class now calls these new originals. This modification allows user to call the functions
  even if no canvas exists yet.
- Fixed mixed multiple selection of child and top-most shapes (all shapes had been assigned to the last clicked shape's parent).
- Fixed potentional assertion fault in wxSFLineShape::OnLeftDoubleClick(const wxPoint& pos) event handler.
- Fixed grid shapes in such way they do not accept line shapes as managed shapes anymore.
- Update and fixed wxSFDemo sample project.
- Code clean-up.

Changes in version 1.6.2 beta (2008-09-27):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer 1.1.7:
  - Function xsPropertyIO::AddPropertyNode() is now static and takes information about xml node type.
  - Function xsSerializable::GetChild() now allows recursive search.
  - IDs of managed serialized items are now serialized automatically by default (in previous library version this task had to be
    done explicitelly by a user).
  - Fixed bug dealing with reading of float and double values on platforms which use ',' decimal character (fix no.2).

- Added wxSFFlexGridShape with a behaviour similar to classic wxFlexGridSizer (each grid's column and row can have different size).
- wxSFShapeBitmap::CreateFromFile() function now takes also bitmap type parameter (use bitmap types supported by wxBitmap class). Previously
  only BMP files were supported.
- wxSFDiagramManager::AddShape(wxClassInfo* shapeInfo, const wxPoint& pos, bool saveState) function doesn't Refresh() new shape anymore
  (the wxSFShapeBase::wxRefresh() must be called explicitelly if neccessary).
- Fixed wxSFGridShape's RTTI information
- Fixed grid shapes minimal size. Even empty grid shape with zero cell space has non-zero size now.

Changes in version 1.6.1 beta (2008-09-24):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer 1.1.6:
  - Added support for new (exported) dynamic data containers (CharArray, IntArray, FloatArray, DoubleArray).
  - Fixed bug dealing with reading of float and double values on platforms which use ',' decimal character.

- Added a posibility to interactivelly change ending line points connected to shapes (it means that the connection lines
  do not point to the shape center only anymore). The ending points can be changed by simple placing of the ending line handles somewhere
  over the shape.
- Added new wxSFGridShape which has the same behaviour like classic wxGridSizer known from wxWidgets (it means that its child shapes
  are layouted into a grid defined by number of rows and columns).
- Added virtual function wxSFShapeBase::OnChildDropped(const wxRealPoint& pos, wxSFShapeBase *child) called when other 
  dragged shape(s) are dropped above target shape (the dropped shapes must be accepted by the target).

- Changed declaration of GetBorderPoint() function. Now it takes two parameters (starting and ending point of a virtual
  line intersecting the shape's border).

- Fixed control shape to proper set its size in accordance to managed GUI control (virtual function wxSFShapeBase::Update () should works now).
- Fixed wxSFDiagramManager::GetNewId() function to respect also ID used in the diagram root item.

- Updated wxSFDemo sample projekt to demonstrate the wxSFGridShape.
- Updated wxSFSample4 (added possibility to create a gui control consisting of wxPanel and wxButton used for the real-time panel resizing).

Changes in version 1.6.0 beta (2008-06-02):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer 1.1.5:
  - Function xsSerializable::AddChild() returns pointer to the added child item. It also sets
    new unique ID to the added object if its previous ID was undefined (in the previous library
    version the ID was assigned by wxXmlSerializer::AddItem() function only).
  - Added support for NaN and INF values for double and float data types (proposed by fantaz).
  - Modified Sample1 code to demonstrate the ability to handle NaN and INF values.
  - Name of function xsSerializable::GetChildren() changed to xsSerializable::GetChildrenList().
  - Added function xsSerializable::GetChildren(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list) returning
    the child objects of given type (or all children if type is NULL).
  - Added function xsSerializable::GetChildrenRecursively(wxClassInfo *type, SerializableList& list) returning
    all child objects of given type recursively (or all children recursively if type is NULL).
  - Function wxXmlSerializer::GetItems(wxClassInfo* type, SerializableList& list) doesn't return
    the number of found items anymore.

- Implemented shadows under shapes. Class wxSFShapeBase has a new style sfsSHOW_SHADOW which causes
  appearance of a shadow under this shape. Shadows can be collectively set by wxSFShapeCanvas::ShowShadows()
  function and the shadow style can be modified by functions SetShadowOffset(), SetShadowFill() and SetShadowTextColour()
  which are member functions of wxSFShapeCanvas class. Also analogical GetXXX() functions are available there.
- Enhanced wxSFDemo sample to show the new shadowing feature.

- Implemented printing support.
- Enhanced wxSFDemo sample to demonstrate this new feature.

- Added new shape (wxSFControlShape) able to manage GUI controls (widgets). Assigned GUI controls can be resized and
  positioned via parent control shape. For more details see the library reference.
- Added new sample project (wxSFSample4) demostrating a usage of wxSFControlShape.

- Added default constructor for wxSFShapeCanvas class. Note that the user must call 
  wxSFShapeCanvas::SetDiagramManager() function later to complete the canvas' initilization.
- Implemented virtual bool wxScrolledWindow::Create() function for two-step canvas window construction.

- Function name wxSFShapeBase::GetChildren(ShapeList& children, bool recursive) changed to
  wxSFShapeBase::GetChildShapes(ShapeList& children, bool recursive)

- All drawing (virtual) functions now use reference to wxDC instead of wxSFScaledPaintDC which leads
  to more universal drawing approach. In addition new global conversion functions called Conv2Point(), Conv2Size()
  and Conv2RealPoint() have been added for easy conversion between wxPoint, wxSize and wxRealPoint() objects
  (these functions are usefull especialy in user-defined drawing routines).

- Fixed compilation problem which occured in wxSFDemo and wxSFSample3 if the wx2.6.x compatibility is switched off
  (due to unknown wxSAVE and wxOPEN defines previously declared in the wxFileDialog).
- Fixed segmentation fault in wxSFDemo3 occured when the DEL key was pressed together with a star title selected.


Changes in version 1.5.2 beta (2008-02-22):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer 1.1.4
- Decimal point in stored real values is always converted to character "." (locale settings are
  ignored). This change may cause some previously saved project unreadable (if your default decimal
  point character is set to ",").
- Enhanced wxSFSample3 project to show some usefull features (some of new shape events, shapes' behaviour
  customizations, etc...).
- Fixed function wxSFShapeCanvas::SetScaleToViewAll()
- Suppressed compiler warnings dealing with unused function arguments (patch from fantaz).
- Added bakefiles-based build system. Also prebuilt makefiles for several platforms have beed 
  included into the release package.
- Source object references in the copy constructors are constant now.

Changes in version 1.5.1 beta (2008-01-22):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer (wxXS) 1.1.3
- Updated code to use wxList::compatibility_iterator instead of pointers to wxNode class (so the
  STL lists are supported now).
- Multiedit control now disappears after usage of the undo/redo commands.
- Improved drawing of curve shapes (lines consisting of only one segment are drawn as a simple lines).
- Improved finding of shapes under a mouse cursor.
- Implemented wxEVT_SF_ON_PASTE event (macro EVT_SF_ON_PASTE) encapsulated by wxSFShapePasteEvent class
  generated when shapes are pasted from the clipboard to a canvas.
- Added function wxSFShapeCanvas::SetScaleToViewAll() which adjusts the diagram scale so all
  elements are visible.
- Improved testing whether the interactive line shape creation process can be started.

Changes in version 1.5.0 beta (2007-12-27):
--------------------------------------------
- Switched to use wxXmlSerializer (wxXS) 1.1.2
- Implemented drag & drop. The D&D operation starts in two cases: if any shape is dragged out of
  the canvas and if any shape is dragged with CTRL key pressed down (in this case the dragged shapes
  are copied to the new location). User can handle dropped shapes via wxSFShapeCanvas::OnDrop() virtual
  function. The function emits new wxEVT_SF_ON_DROP event (encapsulated by new wxSFShapeDropEvent class)
  in its default implementation.
- Significantly improved library performance/drawing speed (also new function wxSFShapeCanvas::GetShapeUnderCursor()
  is provided.)
- Significantly improved Undo/Redo speed. The canvas history manager (wxSFCanvasHistory) now can
  work in two modes: using standard serialization (default, no extra code needed) or using canvas clonning
  (fast, small extra code overhead is needed). See the documentation and samples for more details.
- Added shape style sfsPROCESS_DEL. If used then the DEL key is processed by the shape, otherwise
  the shape is deleted by the shape canvas.
- Added shape style sfsSHOW_HANDLES. If used then the shape's handles are shown if the shape is 
  selected (even if the sfsSIZE_CHANGE style is not present).
- The shape canvas background can be filled with a gradient brush (use canvas style sfsGRADIENT_BACKGROUND and functions
  wxSFShapeCanvas::SetGradientFrom() and wxSFShapeCanvas::SetGradientTo()).
- Updated samples to reflect new features.
- Fixed function wxSFShapeCanvas::GetShapeUnderCursor() (now it omits inactive or invisible shapes).
- Fixed double generation of the wxEVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE event.
- Fixed code so it doesn't generate assertion messages on Linux platform with debug version of wxWidgets anymore.
- Fixed some issues in shapes' and shape manager's copy constructors (all diagram manager's content can be now 
  copied via its copy constructor or function wxXmlSerializer::CopyItems() - please, for more information
  see the library documentation).

Changes in version 1.4.1 beta (2007-12-07):
--------------------------------------------
- Improved (accelerated) function wxSFShapeCanvas::GetTopmostHandleAtPosition().
- Improved wxXmlSerializer (XS_DECLARE_IO_HANDLER and XS_DEFINE_IO_HANDLER macros are
  now available for easy implementation of custom data types I/O handlers)
- Fixed wxShapeCanvas::Copy() and wxShapeCanvas::Cut() functions. Lines connected to 
  the copied shapes are copied as well.
- Fixed potential crash in wxDiagramManager::RemoveShapes() occured when double-linked shapes
  were removed.
- Improved canvas draving
- Removed accessor functions for partial canvas flags (UseGrid(), ShowGrid(), EnableMultiselection(), EnableMultiSizeChange()).
  These and some new canvas's flags can be now managed via universal canvas member functions SetStyle(), AddStyle(), RemoveStyle()
  and ContainsStyle(). See the canvas class's STYLE enumeration for all available flags.

Changes in version 1.4.0 beta (2007-11-22):
--------------------------------------------
- New (more flexible) version of wxXmlSerializer (saved files are compatible with the previous version).
- Project's directory structure fulfills requirements for integration into wxWidgets/wxAdditions
  distribution (all headers are now located in '../wx/wxsf' and 'wx/wxxmlserializer' subdirs).
- Line shapes connecting child shapes with their parents starts/end at the parent's border, not the center.
- Fixed crash occuring when a parent shape connected with his child shape is removed
- Added "premake" build system

Changes in version 1.3.2 beta (2007-10-26):
--------------------------------------------
- Functions GetAssignedConnections() and GetNeighbours() now allow definition of the connection line type.
- Added function wxSFEditTextShape::EditLabel() which starts label's editation process.
- F2 key now starts the editable shape's label editation mode.
- wxXmlSerializer now allows serialization of its root node properties. Requested behaviour can be set by agrument 'withroot'
  of wxXmlSerializer::SerializeToXml() functions.

Changes in version 1.3.1 beta (2007-09-26):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed wxSFShapeBase::GetCompleteBoundingBox() function to respect non-zero horizontal
  and verical shape borders.
- Fixed drawing of multiline text shapes during scaling of the whole shape canvas.
- wxSFShapeBase::Update() function is now called recursively for all parents.
- Implemented wxEVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE event (macro EVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE). 
- Added wxSFShapeCanvas::OnTextChange() event handler called by the franework if any ediatble text shape
  is changed (default implementation generates the wxEVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE event).
- Fixed initialization of text shapes after the deserialization if the shape canvas doesn't exist yet.
- Fixed shape resizing problems occured if the shape has one or more children aligned to
  the right or bottom.
- Function wxSFBitmapShape::CreateFromXPM() is now public.
- Partial shape flags (m_fParentChange, m_fSizeChange, m_fPositionChange, m_fAlwaysInside,
  m_fHovering and m_fHighlighting) with relevant accessors have been replaced with 
  one common style property (see STYLE enumeration and wxSFShapeBase::SetStyle(), 
  wxSFShapeBase::GetStyle(), AddStyle(), RemoveStyle(), ContainsStyle() functions). This modification makes
  the wxSF much more flexible and reduces size of the project XML files (only one property (style) is now
  serialized instead of many partial flags).
- Optimized drawing.
- Associated user data now knows its parent shape (via xsSerializable::GetParent() function).
- Unvisible shapes aren't drawn anymore...
- Non-active shapes can't be selected by multiedit control
- Fixed crash during removing of shape whose children are connected via lines with another shapes.
- Code clean-up.

Changes in version 1.3.0 beta (2007-09-07):
--------------------------------------------
- wxSF ported to use wxXmlSerialization (new mini-library suitable for automated serialization/
  deserialization of class objects (arranged into a list or a tree) and their properties 
  (attributes) to/from XML files). The wxXmlSerialization library is shipped together with the wxSF 
  and can be used free and separately in other projects.
- Implemented a container for user-defined data (objects derived from xsSerializable class) which can be
  assigned to the shape and serialized with it (wxSFShapeBase::SetUserData(), wxSFShapeBase::
  GetUserData(), wxSFShapeBase::DeleteUserDataOnDestroy()).
- Implemented wxEVT_SF_LINE_DONE event (macro EVT_SF_LINE_DONE) and related event class 
wxSFShapeEvent.
- Applied compiler symbol WXMAKINGDLL_SF which allows compile the dynamic library with defined 
  WXDLLEXPORT flags.
- Added support for so called 'composed shapes' (for more details see wxSFSample3).
- Added three new sample projects to the library sources distribution.
- Improved C::B and MS Visual Studio project and solution files on Windows.
- Added C::B project files for Linux.
- Fixed shape handles' drawing on Linux.
- Fixed wxSFShapeCanvas::Paste() on Linux.
- Unified look&feel on both Windows and Linux target platforms.
- Succesfully tested with wxWidgets 2.8.4 on Windows XP SP2 (both 32- 
and 64-bit versions), Windows Vista and Linux (Ubuntu 7.04).
- Changed the development status from 'aplha' to 'beta'.
- Several minor bug fixes.

  NOTE: wxSF project file format is not comapatible with previous versions.

Changes in version 1.2.4 alpha (2007-08-10):
--------------------------------------------
- Removed assertion of valid pointer to diagram manager in a shape's destructor.
- Shapes acceptance list in diagram manager is tested for record duplicity

Changes in version 1.2.3 alpha (2007-08-03):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed function wxSFShapeBase::GetCompleteBoundingBox().
- Fixed update of shapes assigned as children to line shapes (alignment of those
  child shapes is ignored).

Changes in version 1.2.2 alpha (2007-08-02):
--------------------------------------------
- Improved testing of invalid pointers among main framework's components (shape base,
  shape canvas and diagram manager) and thus whole library stability.

Changes in version 1.2.1 alpha (2007-07-30):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed ability to work with shapes without need of existing shape canvas.

Changes in version 1.2.0 alpha (2007-07-27):
--------------------------------------------
- Separated data and presentation layer (see wxSFDiagramManager and wxSFShapeCanvas classes)
- Updated example code to demonstrate this feature (v1.5)
- Added function wxSFShapeBase::AssignChild()
- Added functions wxSFShapeBase::SetAlwaysInsideParent() and wxSFShapeBase::IsAlwaysInsideParent().
  If the property is set to TRUE then shape's parent is always resized to fit this shape, otherwise
  a size change of child shape doesn't involve parent shape's size.

Changes in version 1.1.6 alpha (2007-07-25):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to define shape types accepted by shape canvas instance (functions
  wxSFShapeCanvas::AcceptShape(), wxSFShapeCanvas::IsShapeAccepted(), wxSFShapeCanvas::ClearAcceptedShapes())
- Updated example code to demonstrate this feature (v1.4)
- Fixed wxSFShapeBase::DoAlignment() function

Changes in version 1.1.5 alpha (2007-07-24):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed function FitToChildren in diamond shape (wxSFDiamondShape)
- Fixed canvas refresh during shape handle dragging
- Added function for alignment of selected shapes in the shape canvas (wxSFShapeCanvas::AlignSelected())
- Updated example code to demonstrate AlignSelected() function

Changes in version 1.1.4 alpha (2007-07-21):
--------------------------------------------
- Various bug fixes, improvements and code clean up
- Function wxSFShapeBase::Scale() can now scale also child shapes

Changes in version 1.1.3 alpha (2007-07-17):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to define shape's alignment (child shape can be aligned
inside its parent with given direction and offset)

Changes in version 1.1.2 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed functions wxSFShapeBase::GetNeighbours() and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetNeighbours()

Changes in version 1.1.1 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to find neighbour shapes (functions wxSFShapeBase::GetNeighbours() and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetNeighbours())

Changes in version 1.1.0 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Enhanced shapes policy (definitions which shape type can be connected to which one, what can be source or what can be target, etc.).
- Ability to get wxSF number from canvas class.
- Several bug fixes.

Changes in version 1.0.0 alpha (2007-07-07):
--------------------------------------------
- Initial release.
