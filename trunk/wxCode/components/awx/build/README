awx 0.3 (advanced wxWidget controls)					28.06.2007
======================================================================

INSTALLATION
------------
After unpacking the awx archive file, you get the following directory
structur.

build
include/wx/awx
lib
samples
src

The awx makefiles are created by the bakefile tool and includes
makefiles for the following compilers:

Borland C/C++ makefile:		makefile.bcc
GNU GCC (Unix) makefile:		GNUmakefile
MinGW makefiles:			makefile.gcc			
MS Visual C++ nmake file:	makefile.vc

Another makefiles could be generated by bakefile on demand.

You can build the library in any folder. Because awx is depending on
the wxWidget package, you have to set the WXWIN enviroment variable on
windows to your current wxWidget installation path. For example:

WXWIN=C:\Programme\wxWidgets-2.6.3

On linux, the wx-config program will be used to detect the right
pathes and Compiler/Linker settings. wx-config is part of the wxWidget
installation.
If you want to create a release and a debug version of the libray,
FIRST build the release and THEN the debug version.

Independent of a debug or release version, each build always creates a
little sample program in the build/release or build/debug folder, there
you can test and play a running awx application. Take a look in the
sample file, to find out, how you can programming with the awx classes.

LINUX GCC COMPILIATION
----------------------
To build and install the library without debugging informations

make DEBUG=0 WX_DEBUG=0
su -
make DEBUG=0 WX_DEBUG=0 install

with debug

make DEBUG=1 WX_DEBUG=1
su -
make DEBUG=1 WX_DEBUG=1 install

Don't forget to run ldconfig (also as root)

MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ COMPILATION
--------------------------------
First the release version:

nmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=0 WX_DEBUG=0
nmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=0 WX_DEBUG=0 wxinstall

The debug version:

nmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=1 WX_DEBUG=1
nmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=1 WX_DEBUG=1 wxinstall

Note! To install the library in the wxWidget lib folder, you have to
rerun the make command with the 'wxinstall' parameter (see above).


BORLAND C++ 5.0/5.5 COMPILATION
-------------------------------

make -f makefile.bcc DEBUG=x WX_DEBUG=x
make -f makefile.vc DEBUG=x WX_DEBUG=x wxinstall
 

WATCOM C++ 10.6/11 AND OPENWATCOM COMPILATION
---------------------------------------------

wmake -f makefile.wat DEBUG=x WX_DEBUG=x
wmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=x WX_DEBUG=x wxinstall *?

*? (I don't have any access to a watcom enviroment)
