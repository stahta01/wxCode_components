Description:
wxSheet is a spreadsheet type grid widget for the wxWidgets GUI library. The wxSheet code
is based on the wxWidget\'s wxGrid class and is, for the most part, a complete rewrite,
almost every function has been tweaked. It is not backwards compatible, but operates and is
logically similiar. Many of the functions have the same names and you can expect them to
perform a similiar task, but the parameters may be different. The reason for creating a
completely separate grid implementation is to allow far more control over the different
aspects of the operation either though subclassing or intercepting events.
