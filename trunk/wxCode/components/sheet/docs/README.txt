===============================================================================
Summary:

    wxSheet is a spreadsheet type grid widget for the wxWidgets GUI library.
The wxSheet code is based on the wxWidget's wxGrid class and is, for the most
part, a complete rewrite, almost every function has been tweaked.
It is not backwards compatible, but operates and is logically similiar.
Many of the functions have the same names and you can expect them to perform a
similiar task, but the parameters may be different. The reason for creating
a completely separate grid implementation is to allow far more control over the
different aspects of the operation either though subclassing or intercepting
events.
    You will find documentation included in the header files with the member
functions ordered by function. You can of course look under the hood, at the
cpp files, to fully understand what each function does.

    I welcome any changes or interesting ideas you may have for
improvement. The current version suits my needs in terms of flexibility, but
I only use a grid widget in a limited capacity.
