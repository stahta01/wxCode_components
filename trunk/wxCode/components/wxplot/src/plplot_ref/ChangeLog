2003-09-01  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Commit (with a few changes) C++ interface upgrade (at least 13 new
	  PLplot library calls are now available) donated by Andrew Ross
	  <andrewr@coriolis.greenend.org.uk> under the LGPL. The Plplot
	  initialization has now been separated which allows plplot commands
	  that are supposed to be done before init (such as command-line
	  option processing) to work for the first time.  This constitutes a
	  backwards-incompatible change that will be signalled by a new
	  libplplotcxx library major version number.

	* Commit (with a few changes) extended set of C++ examples donated
	  by Andrew Ross <andrewr@coriolis.greenend.org.uk> under the LGPL.
	  These examples test the interface by attempting to mimic the
	  results of the corresponding C examples.

	* x01cc.c: Change this one old (but still interesting) C++ example
	  to use the updated interface.

	* examples/c++/Makefile.am: extend the install to the new examples,
	  create symlink for lena.pgm (so x20 works), and use install-hook
	  (no more .samename) for post-install changes.

2003-02-01  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sysloc.in: Remove unneeded cruft.  This is a substantial (28 per
	  cent) reduction in the size of this large file.  The result has
	  been tested with essentially all drivers both for the dynamic
	  driver and static driver case. scripts/make_tarball.sh:

2003-01-19  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* scripts/make_tarball.sh: new script for preparing release tarball
	  tree.

	* rpm/plplot_redhat7.3.spec: update to plplot-5.2.0.
	
	* plplot-5.2.0 release!


2003-01-15  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Cleaned out hundreds of zombied files that were in the Attic
	  with wrong state information that screwed up cvs -D option
	  cvs merges, etc.

	* Make 8th, 9th and 11th Python examples consistent with recently
	  changed C examples.  This concludes the Python consistency effort
	  (at least until the next change in the C examples).

	* Make 8th, 9th and 11th Tcl examples consistent with recently
	  changed C examples.  This concludes the Tcl consistency effort (at
	  least until the next change in the C examples). All python and
	  java examples now agree exactly in their results, and tcl examples
	  agree quite closely also with java and python.  The long-standing
	  discrepancy in the last page of example 9 between the C example
	  and now all of the java, python, and tcl examples persists both
	  for single and double precision libplplot (and C example 9). So
	  this suggests there may be some problem with the C example 9, but
	  I cannot find it!
	  

2003-01-04  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Make 9th and 11th Java examples consistent with recently changed C
	  examples.  This concludes the Java consistency effort (at least
	  until the next change in the C examples).  Most java examples
	  agree exactly with their C counterpart.  The worst difference is a
	  long-standing discrepancy in the last page of example 9 where the
	  potential plot contours are slightly but visibly different between
	  C and Java no matter what I try.  The two other example
	  discrepancies that show up with diff are quite minor and don't
	  seem to correspond to anything visible.
	  

2003-01-02  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Make 8th Java example give the same result (to 1 unit in last
	  digit of postscript file) as new 8th C example.  This involved
	  defining some additional constants for the swig java interface
	  file as well as substantial changes in x08.java.

2002-12-31  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Changed version number of PLplot package *and* associated
	  libraries to 5.2.0 in anticipation of the forthcoming release.  To
	  get this to work properly must have a fresh checkout or else run
	  'make distclean' before trying this change.

	* test/plplot-test.sh.in test/test_java.sh : Added the java examples
	  to our test procedure which builds all of our non-interactive
	  example plots.  Also tweaked most of the remaining scripts in
	  test.

2002-12-31  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Finished Java swig-based interface to Plplot for now.  Current
	  limitations are detailed in bindings/java/README.javaAPI.

	* Made the appropriate python interface changes so we are now
	  uniformly based on swig version 1.3.17 for both our java and
	  python interfaces!  The required changes turned out to be minimal,
	  but absolutely necessary because of a paradigm shift that occurred
	  in the swig approach for earlier versions of the unstable swig
	  1.3.x series.

2002-12-30  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implement plParseOpts for new Java interface and change all
	  examples to use it again.

2002-12-29   Maurice LeBrun <mlebrun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bindings/tk: added sample app-defaults files, howto on their
	  use, and code to suck the app-defaults file "PLplot" into the
	  options db, which is then used to set geometry, fonts, colors,
	  etc.

2002-12-29  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implement additional 2-d arrays for the swig-based Java API. These
	  new typemaps allow plcont (and x09.java) to work.  Note, only the
	  2-d version is implemented, there is no angle wrap code, and kx,
	  lx, ky, ly always have to be in the argument list.  In other words
	  this is the raw java interface to PLplot.  Thus, a number of
	  adjustments had to be made to x09.java to work with this raw
	  interface.  However, once the user-friendly interface is done, it
	  should be possible to overload 1-d arrays when needed for xg0
	  through yg1, have angle wrap code, and also drop kx, lx, ky, ly.

	* Implement typemaps for defined_func and fill_func which allow
	  x15.java and x16.java to work properly.  Note, I removed the
	  local versions of plshades from x16.java since plshades is now
	  defined in the PLplot java interface API.  

2002-12-28  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implement the simpler 2-d arrays for the swig-based Java API.  This
	  means all examples work other than x09 (contours), x15 (shade plots
	  with plshade), and x16 (shade plots with plshades).

2002-12-27  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implement new swig-based Java API.  Two-dimensional arrays are
	  not implemented yet which means 6 of the examples do not work,
	  but the rest do work, and in fact example 18 works completely
	  for the first time ever because all PLplot functions in the common
	  API that have variable or one-dimensional array arguments have been 
	  completely implemented in Java.

2002-12-24  Maurice LeBrun <mlebrun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* examples/tcl/x??: Added script file front-ends to Tcl example
	  programs.  Locates pltcl via PATH.
	* examples/tcl/Makefile.am: install rule for these
	
	* examples/*/Makefile.examples.in: Explicitly specify --mode=link
	  to plplot_libtool in order to correctly work with vendor compilers.

	* src/plctrl.c: Fix to 'Bug in library: Segmentation fault if "Q" hit'

2002-12-24  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* examples/*/Makefile.examples.in: clean target

	* examples/*/Makefile.am: implement install of Makefile.examples
	  renamed to Makefile for user convenience.

	* bindings/octave/Makefile.am: implement separate creation of
	  plplot_octave.oct for build area and install area.

2002-12-23  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* examples/*/Makefile.examples.in: use CC, CXX, and F77 symbols to
	  avoid hard-coded compiler names.

2002-12-22  Maurice LeBrun <mlebrun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: AM_CONFIG_HEADER must be called *before* AC_DEFINE's
	  This solves infamous -dev tk problem and also problems with
	  ./xtk?? -f tk??

2002-12-12  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Implement autotools support for building and installing java
	  plplot wrapper library, libplplotjava, java/plplot/core classes,
	  and installing java source for examples in java/plplot/examples.

2002-12-13  "[iso-8859-1] João Cardoso" <jcard@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed p7 and p15 problem.  This finishes the last of the problems
	  with the octave examples.  (x example segfaults solved earlier
	  by plend ==> plend1 change in those examples.)

2002-12-12  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: Drop ".so" suffix from records in created drivers.db.
	  Apparently, this makes libtldl work properly on OSF1, and it
	  still also works properly on Linux with this change.

2002-12-11  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/plcore.c: reactivate release of libltdl resources in plend.

	* bindings/octave/demos/x??c.m: plend ==> plend1.

	* drivers/Makefile.am, configure.ac: xflags and lmflag activated for
	  drivers which need linking to X libraries or the math library.
	  Additional AM_CONDITIONALS were done in configure.ac to help
	  implement this.

2002-12-09  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: only run AM_PATH_PYTHON(1.5) if python is enabled.

	* bindings/Makefile.am: if enable_tcl is not yes, then no attempt is
	  made to create pkgIndex.tcl. This should fix the problems Joao was
	  having in an environment without tcl.  Later this should be
	  changed to depend on the more general has_tcl instead, but AWI's
	  opinion is that has_tcl is broken in sysloc.in at the moment so we
	  will stick with depending on enable_tcl for a while.

	* src/plcore.c: Change from lt_dlopen to lt_dlopenext for more
	  cross-platform suffix generality.

	* sysloc.in: has_tcl is now set to enable_tcl.

	* bindings/Makefile.am: pkgIndex.tcl now only built if tcl enabled.

	* utils/Makefile.am: pltcl now only built if tcl enabled.

	* src/plcore.c: Comment out premature removal of libltdl resources
	  in plend since plinit may be called again after a call to plend.  In
	  fact there is no way to guarantee any particular call to plend is
	  the last so these libltdl resources must always remain allocated
	  until the overall programme exits.

2002-12-07  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: Make tk and tkwin static drivers work. This
	  completes the static drivers configuration.

	* bindings/t*/pkgIndex.tcl.in: search for Pltk and Plplotter entry
	  points in libplplot if a search in the dynamic drivers fails.
	  This is required for static drivers since in that case the entry 
	  points (and drivers) are put in libplplot.
	  
	* PROBLEMS: reorganization and updating to help set our priorities
	  for what must be accomplished before the next release.

2002-12-06  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

        * Configure test executables in examples for c++, f77, and tk.  make
	  check builds the uninstalled c, c++, f77, and tk examples fine,
	  and plplot-test.sh works with these uninstalled examples with some
	  limitations that are discussed on list.

	* Make all static drivers (except for tk and tkwin whose
	  implementation will be more complicated) work using the automake
	  convenience library approach.

2002-12-05  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Configure test executables in examples/c/Makefile.am
	
	* Clean up Makefile.am files and also switch from LIBADD to LDFLAGS
	  for interlibrary dependencies as suggested by documentation.
	  
	* Change fortran and C++ driver names to libplplotf77 and libplplotcxx
	  because of name-clash concerns.

2002-12-04  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Begin configuration of octave using autotools.  plplot_octave.oct
	  builds and installs, but no other part of octave is done yet.
	  Note this and all future autotools work is being done on the MAIN
	  branch.
	  
	* plplot_octave.oct build with Joao's recent gcc 3.2.x fix.

	* (mostly) finish configuration of octave using autotools.  Over
	  to Joao now to sort out why the installed p7.m and p15.m examples
	  don't work and why none of the x??.m examples work.


2002-12-03  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* With a lot of work required to work around state problems in the
	  repository, merged the AT branch into MAIN.  Welcome to the world
	  of autotools configuration on our MAIN branch!

2002-12-02  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* drivers/Makefile.am for AT branch: instead of using the
	  concatanation of all compiler flags for all dynamic drivers, apply
	  only those compiler flags that are appropriate to each dynamic
	  driver.  This makes a huge reduction in the command line when
	  gnome driver flags are involved, and probably saves significant
	  computer time as well when you avoid searching all those gnome
	  header directories for each dynamic driver.
	  
	* test/Makefile.am, etc for AT branch.  Bring test directory under
	  autotools control. Result is that plplot-test.sh runs in the
	  installed examples directory and gives identical results with the
	  MAIN branch (except in a few cases where there is version skew
	  between the examples since AT was branched from MAIN).

2002-12-01  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Finish (nearly) all the dynamic driver builds for AT. Checked that
	  gnome, png, xfig, ntk all worked.  Also, package require Plplotter
	  (which accesses the tkwin_drv.so shared object) also works, and
	  -dev tkwin works (although it simply returns the usual error
	  message about no widget being available since this is not a
	  stand-alone driver).  As far as I know, the only driver that still
	  has errors under AT is tk.

2002-11-30  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Finish AT libplplottcltk.so* build when itcl and tk are enabled.

	* bindings/tk for AT: build and install plserver and *.tcl, *.itk,
	  and palette (*.pal) files.

	* acinclude.m4 copied (again) from cf/aclocal.m4 for AT branch to
	  pick up all the autoconf 2.5.3 changes.

2002-11-29  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Finish AT tcl binding.  These are only small fairly
	  non-consequential refinements that I did while trying to debug the
	  extended search problem (which had a simple solution which I will
	  discuss on list).

	* Prepare for the AT change in bindings/tk and bindings/tk-x-plat 
	  by dropping "plplot/" from the #include statements in the 
	  source files.
	
2002-11-28  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AT build of libplplottcl (including a substantial reorganization
	  of configure.in).

	* AT build of utilities plrender, pltek, and pltcl.

	* AT reorganize src/Makefile.am, but no substantive changes.

2002-11-27  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Creation of python extension modules now works.  Replaced the
	  setup.py method (which had some cross-platform question marks)
	  with a libtools method.

	* Fixed build of xwin_drv.so so it links to libplplot.  Without this
	  the python examples won't work with the xwin driver.
	
	* Install of python examples including new plplot_python_start.py
	  which is configured to make accessible to python the
	  directory which contains the installed plplot python extensions
	  (assuming that might not be in the standard system location).

	* Fixed single precision bugs in bindings/c++/Makefile.am and
	  bindings/f77/Makefile.am.

2002-11-26  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Support for examples/c examples/c++ and examples/f77 on AT
	  branch.
	* Adopt Maurice's idea of initializing libltdl in pllib_init().
	* Makefile.examples using plplot_libtool, c works
	* c++ works (required a fix to linking of libplcxx consistent
	  with hierarchical linking model.)
	* f77 works (required a fix to linking of libplf77 consistent
	  with hierarchical linking model.)

2002-11-25  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am files: some reorganization, but mostly adding
	  EXTRA_DIST macros so the distributed tarball generated by
	  make dist has everything it needs.
	* configure.in and /bindings/f77/Makefile.am: Cross-platform 
	  glitches fixed for solaris.

2002-11-24  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Add plConfig.h to installed headers.
	* Remove aclocal.m4 from cvs control (was stale cvs deleted file which
	  is automatically generated in any case with an up-to-date version
	  using ./bootstrap.sh).
	* Makefile.am files: add support for libltdl.
	* include/disptab.h: New PLDispatchInit typedef consistent with lt_ptr.
	* include/plcore.h: Change dlhand type.
	* src/plcore.c: Switch from dlopen API to libltdl API (a fair number
	  of changes because of new types for dlopen and dlsym equivalents,
	  and need for lt_dlinit() and lt_dlexit() calls which I chose to
	  make for each stream created and destroyed.)

2002-11-23  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FREETYPEINCCMD and FREETYPELIBCMD

2002-11-22  Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Initial creation (from resurrected AM-LT merged into 20021122
	  MAIN HEAD) and checkin of AT branch.  Details given on plplot_devel 
	  list.
	* .cvsignore files: convenience changes.
	* Makefile.am: reorder src first, then drivers (since dynamic 
	  drivers depend on src).  Will take care of static drivers later.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch the old
	  drivers list to a new complete devices list.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch drivers list
	  to complete devices list.
	* configure.in: incorporate HEAD static and dynamic driver handling
	  from old cf/configure.in. Changed DATA_DIR back to current standard
	  ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS, DRIVERS_DB. Current standard for dynamic driver
	  names.
	* drivers/Makefile.am: Current static drivers don't work, but
	  added working versions of xwin and ps dynamic drivers.
	* drivers/ps.c: PLPLOT_VERSION ==> VERSION
	* examples/c/*.c examples/c/*.h: change to old include style without
	  the "plplot/".
	* src/Makefile.am: completed list of files to include in libplplot;
	  hacked in -lm -ldl -lfreetype (freetype should be option); and
	  disabled use of convenience library for static drivers (to be
	  revisited later).
	* */Makefile.am: change to LGPL license as agreed with Rafael
	* COPYING: copy from COPYING.LIB, the text of the LGPL   Otherwise, 
	  automake generates a GPL License file which is not appropriate for 
	  LGPLed PLplot.
