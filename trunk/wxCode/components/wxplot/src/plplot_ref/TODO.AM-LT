This file is here just to get my work organized.  It will hopefully
disappear when the AM-LT branch will get merged into MAIN.  [N.B.: the
merge has already be done since a while.  I am keeping old items here that
do not seem to be fully implemented already.  RL, on 2003-11-28.]

* examples:

    The examples directory must be ported to Automake.  The ultimate goal
    is to combine Alan's test scripts with the command "make test".

* bindings/tcl, drivers/tk (also iTcl/Tk):

    Just inherit most of what is done already in cf/*.in.  In the Tcl/Tk
    8.3 tarball there exists a tcl.m4, which tries to read configuration
    settings from the file tclConfig.sh.  This is a good starting point for
    a more principled Tcl/Tk configuration.


* bindings/python:

    Same comments as for the Tcl/Tk bindings.  In release 1.4d of Automake,
    there is a python.m4 file that could be useful for us.  Look at :
    http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/automake/m4/?cvsroot=automake

* Maurice's user configurability:

    The ability to source the cf_plplot.in file has been added to the
    AM-LT's configure.in.  However, much of the stuff there must be revised
    in accordance to how things are set in the new AM/LT scenario.


ITEMS BELOW HAVE BEEN COMPLETED OR ARE ABANDONED

* Merge with Geoffrey's dyndrv branch:

    This merge will be less problematic than I have foreseen.  Actually,
    the branches AM-LT and dyndrv are complementary in this area.  On
    dyndrv, the important thing is the code in src/.  On AM-LT, there is
    also provisions for building Litool "modules" (a.k.a. "plug-ins", or
    dynloaded obhjects).  A big plus here will be the use of Libtool's
    libltdl library.  Also, Geoffrey has designed a very neat system for
    driver:device initialization in Autoconf.
    => DONE

* bindings/perl:

    For this, I will have to integrate ExtUtils::MakeMaker with Automake.
    I am sure that this can be done without much hassle.
    => ABANDONED, SINCE PDL BINDINGS ALREADY EXIST.

* Extra distribution files:

    Several files should be included into the distribution tarball by using
    the Automake variable EXTRA_DIST and *_SCRIPTS.  The hard part of this
    task is to audit the whole CVS tree to decide which files should be
    included or not.
    => DONE

* plplot-config:

    This script has to undergo major changes, since I am planning to
    deliver a AM-LT branch merged against dyndrv.  Since some drivers may
    be dynamically loaded in particular installations, some new options
    should be added, like --with-tk, --with-xwin, etc.  Of course, the
    script has to behave nicely when drivers are build statically into
    libplplot.
    => I OFICIALLY ABANDONED THIS PROJECT, TAKEN OVER BY ALAN.

* Library version:

    This has to be discussed on plplot-devel.  The PLplot project has been
    using a undesirable approach to determine the soname release number of
    the libplplot library.  In sum, we are setting the library release
    number equal to the package version number.  This is plain wrong and we
    should use the Libtool's system (see the Libtool manual for a
    justification for that).

    However, Libtool's library version mechanism imposes some constraints
    here.  In order to increase the library number from 5.0.3 to 5.1.0, I
    have to use "-version-info 6:0:1".  This works for Linux, but in HP-UX,
    it produces libplplot6.
    => NOT A MATTER OF DISCUSSION ANYMORE.  WE ARE FOLLOWING THE "OFFICIAL"
       RULES, AS PRESENT IN THE LIBTOOL DOCUMENTATION.
