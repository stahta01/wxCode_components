This code has is being developed and used under i386/Linux. I do not think
there will be major problems for porting it elsewhere. Please let me know if
you managed to do it.

To compile, run:

configure
make
(make install)

For a couple of quick tests, run:

make tests
./nnphi_test
./nnai_test
./ht_test

Apart from the `nn' library, this code contains `nnbathy' -- a simple 
interpolation utility/example based on `nn'. Look in ./example to try or test 
it.

Acknowledgments:
This library uses `Triangle' by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk for Delaunay 
triangulation -- thanks, Richard, well done!

Good luck!
