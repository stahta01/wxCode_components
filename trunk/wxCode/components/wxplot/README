Please, before to build the libraries edit the current Makefile (in
this case (.Windows or .Linux), for a custom flags or paths.

I think that is easy to write new Makefiles taken the existing:

make

make lib (to build the library - libplot.a)

make install (to copy the needed files in the wxwindows path)

make clean (to erase the object files)
----------------------------------------------------------------
To build the example, go to the demowxplot directory:

make

----------------------------------------------------------------
SOME NOTES

-The fonts file plxtnd5.fnt has to be inside the directory of the
application (demo in the first case) (this is a plplot limitation, I think so).

-You have to add the extra word -lplot to the link flags on your programs.
----------------------------------------------------------------

wxPlot constructor.

- wxPlot(&dc, w, h);

Where dc is a DrawCanvas object and w and h are the vertical and
horizontal dimensions of the canvas respectively.

- If you use the OnDraw method, don't forgot to delete the wxPlot
  object at the end.

  delete(wxplot) (for example).

  documentation:
