Subdir:     splitwindow

Description:
wxSplitWindow allows to split a window into 2 subwindows either horizontal
or vertical with a sash in between. It's similar to wxSpitterWindow but it
doesn't destroy any window if unsplit. So the 2 partial windows can always
be access regardless if split or unsplit.
