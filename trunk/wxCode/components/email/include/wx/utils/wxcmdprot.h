/**
 * \internal
 *
 * This class is the base class of all command-line oriented internet protocols.
 *
 * Each protocol shall derive a set of wxCmdlineProtocol::State. The system is always
 * in one (and only one) state. This class will propagate the different connection events
 * in the current state :
 *     - Connection events
 *     - Disconnection events
 *     - Response line from the server
 *     - Timeout events.
 *
 * This class offers mechanisms to
 *      - Change the current state
 *      - Send commands to the server
 *      - Set/reset timeout conditions that will be triggered
 *      - Initiate connection and disconnection to server
 *
 * Any command-line protocol can thus be implemented by implementing a
 * set of states, each one performing desired state transitions on the
 * different events generated, and implementing the communication with
 * the server.
