Description:
Tar streams for wxWidgets. This is beta software.

The tar streams are in src/tarstrm.cpp and include/wx/tarstrm.h.
You can include these in your own project (there's no makefile to
build them into a lib).

Currently there is no tar specific docs, however see the docs
about archive classes in general:
http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin_wxarc.html

There is an example program in 'samples/arc.cpp', and a cppunit
test suite in the 'tests' directory.

You can generate makefiles for the tests and sample as follows
(makefiles will be included in the tarball when this is
released):

check out the component, e.g.:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode login 
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode co wxCode/components/wxarchive

then move it to wxWidgets/contrib, e.g:

$ mv wxCode/components/wxarchive wxWidgets/contrib

(so you should have a directory 'wxWidgets/contrib/wxarchive').

Makefiles can be generated using wxWidgets' bakefiles. Bakefile
can be obtained from (http://bakefile.sourceforge.net). Create
(or add to) Bakefiles.local.bkgen in your
wxWidgets/build/bakefiles directory:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<bakefile-gen>
    <input>
        ../../contrib/wxarchive/*/*.bkl
    </input>
</bakefile-gen>

Then run bakefile_gen (from inside the wxWidgets/build/bakefiles dir):

    bakefile_gen -b '../../contrib/wxarchive/*/*.bkl'

As well as the tests in the 'tests' directory there is also a
test script 'samples/arctest.sh' which tests the sample program
against zip, pkzip, tar and pax if they are in the path.  By
default it looks for 'arc' in the current directory (so 'cd' to
wherever 'arc' is then run the script).

The script is a Bourne shell script, it can also be run on
Windows using MSYS or Cygwin.
