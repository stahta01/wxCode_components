Description:
An interface for reading and writing archive formats, with
implementations for zip and tar.

Currently there is an example program samples/arc.cpp, and the
generic wxArchive classes. I haven't uploaded the zip and tar
classes yet (soon), and it won't do anything useful without
them of course.

To try it out, check out the component, e.g.:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode login 
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode co wxCode/components/wxarchive

then move it to wxWidgets/contrib, e.g:

$ mv wxCode/components wxWidgets/contrib

Makefiles can be generated using wxWidgets' bakefiles
(a temporary measure). Bakefile can be obtained from
(http://bakefile.sourceforge.net). Create (or add to)
Bakefiles.local.bkgen in your wxWidgets/build/bakefiles directory:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<bakefile-gen>
    <input>
        ../../contrib/components/*/*.bkl
        ../../contrib/components/*/*/*.bkl
        ../../contrib/components/*/*/*/*.bkl
    </input>
</bakefile-gen>

Then run bakefile_gen (from inside the wxWidgets/build/bakefiles dir):

    bakefile_gen -b '../../contrib/components/wxarchive/*/*.bkl'
