Description:
An interface for reading and writing archive formats, with
implementations for zip and tar.

Currently there is an example program (samples/arc.cpp),
a test script (samples/arctest.sh), the generic wxArchive
classes (include/wx/archive.h) and the zip classes
(include/wx/zipstrm2.h). The tar classes will follow shortly.

To try it out, check out the component, e.g.:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode login 
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode co wxCode/components/wxarchive

then move it to wxWidgets/contrib, e.g:

$ mv wxCode/components wxWidgets/contrib

Makefiles can be generated using wxWidgets' bakefiles, a temporary
arrangement (i.e. hijacking wxWidgets' files is a temporary
measure, I'll keep on using bakefile of course). Bakefile can be
obtained from (http://bakefile.sourceforge.net). Create (or add to)
Bakefiles.local.bkgen in your wxWidgets/build/bakefiles directory:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<bakefile-gen>
    <input>
        ../../contrib/components/*/*.bkl
        ../../contrib/components/*/*/*.bkl
        ../../contrib/components/*/*/*/*.bkl
    </input>
</bakefile-gen>

Then run bakefile_gen (from inside the wxWidgets/build/bakefiles dir):

    bakefile_gen -b '../../contrib/components/wxarchive/*/*.bkl'

The test script tests the arc sample program against itself, and
will also test it against zip/unzip and pkzip/pkunzip if they are
in the path. By default it looks for 'arc' in the current directory
(so 'cd' to wherever 'arc' is then run the script).

It's a unix shell script (probably not a very good idea), but it
runs ok on MSYS or Cygwin on Windows.
