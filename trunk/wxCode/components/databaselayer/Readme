Component: DatabaseLayer

wxWidgets: Only tested on 2.5.x and 2.6.x so far

Description: DatabaseLayer provides a JDBC-like interface to database I/O.
So far only SQLite3, Firebird, MySQL, Postgresql, and ODBC database backends are supported.
MiniCppUnit unit tests are used to make it easier to add more database backends in the future.
