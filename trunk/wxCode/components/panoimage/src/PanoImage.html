<p><b>What's new:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Parallelization.</b> A first attempt at multi-threaded support has arrived!
It's a very exciting day for me, as it is my first multi-threaded application,
ever (but not my first parallel application). It actually feels slower
than the single-threaded version because the appearance of frames are not
evenly spaced, so two appear at once and then there is a more than normal
lag until it processes a third frame. I invented a predictive parallel
approach where the next view is predicted based on previous views requested.
When a view is requested, the next one is predicted and computation is
started. This technique can use only two threads because of the one-frame
look ahead. Further extrapolation is easy to do, though increasingly inaccurate.</li>

<li>
<b>Mouse support fixed.</b> Thanks to a few comments of advice, <b>CaptureMouse()</b>
was added, which helped a lot. A new acceleration routine was implemented,
which feels better than the first one.</li>

<li>
<b>Options dialog started:</b> The options dialog has one slider now which
adjusts mouse/pan acceleration according to my acceleration algorithm.
More options will follow.</li>

<li>
<b>Further encapsulation:</b> It's now shamefully easy to incorporate the
panorama class into your own applications. Multithreading and other low-level
stuff is completely hidden, but can be adjusted through built-in options
dialogs.</li>
</ul>
<b>Problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Frame rate speed: </b>The image speed problems mentioned in version
1.0 persist. Although there were some recommendations about caching bitmaps
to save on conversion, such techniques will not work for this case. It
seems that the only option for more speed is to write platform-dependent
code. However, I am quite optimistic about frame rate improvements because
the other Windows viewer that uses Helmut's code is not _that_ much faster,
and I have only a 233MHz processor.</li>

<li>
<b>Mystery crashes:</b> I still have not quite gotten the hang of the wxThread
class, I guess, because I get mystery crashes every once in a while. <b>gdb</b>
doesn't help, and there are no error messages given. It could have to do
with memory allocation problems, but the problem is too intermittent for
me to solve now.</li>
</ul>
<b>Future plans:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Parallelization:</b> Adjust the timing on my predictive approach and
continue to work with Helmut to achieve finer grained parallel processing.</li>

<li>
<b>User/Automatic configuration:</b> I still like the idea of auto-caliberation
of panning speed. Basically, the inputs are the number of processors and
the speed of processors. At opposite extremes are jerky panning and smooth
panning. If a steady rate of motion is the idea (i.e., be able to pan 360
in 1 second), then smoothness must be compromised. It seems to me that
it will always be the case that users prefer responsiveness to extremely
smooth panning.</li>

<li>
<b>Better mouse control:</b> I am now considering a logarithmic panning
acceleration algorithm which levels off as the user moves the mouse to
the edge or beyond the edge of the panorama window.</li>

<li>
<b>MDI panos</b>: I would like to see just how many panoramas I can display
at once using my class.</li>

<li>
<b>Multiple panos, single panel, layout constraints</b>: Almost like the
security TV screens which are divided into sections. This, however, you
can enlarge when you desire.</li>

<li>
<b>Netscape plugin: </b>I think it's possible</li>

<li>
<b>wxLIVID or wxMM inclusion:</b> The LivePicture viewer can play .WAV
files and show MPEG movies, distorted and everything. Pretty neat. We should
see if wxWin is fast enough for that (I think it is).</li>

<li>
<b>Hotspot links to other panos</b></li>
</ul>

wxWindows Panorama viewer component, v1.0.</h3>
<b>Download:</b>
<br><a href="../../../../source.zip">Source</a>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>What is it:</b>
<br>This is a self-contained panorama viewer class for wxWindows. As my
skeleton app demonstrates, it is used like any other wxWindows object.
Its back end is made with code from Helmut Dersch's <a href="http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch/">Panorama
Tools Viewer for Xwindows</a>.
<p><b>Rational:</b>
<br>The wxWindows <b>PanoImage</b> class was made to encapsulate Helmut's
C code to give it a C++ interface. I wanted an easy way for wxWindows developers
to include a panorama viewer in their applications. After programming so
long in C++, I have started taking certain things like initialization for
granted. Hemlut's code does not self-initialize, but my <b>PanoImage</b>
class does it automatically so users no longer have to worry about correct
initialization. Helmut's code also makes liberal use of pointers, which
has also been hidden from wxWindows developers.
<p><b>Implementation:</b>
<br>I did not make any significant modifications to Helmut's code because
I wanted to allow him flexibility to improve the library according to his
plans. Instead, I made a <b>PanoImage</b> class, which is derived from
a <b>wxPanel</b>. This class insulates Helmut's code from wxWindows as
much as possible and allows wxWindows users to use data structures which
are familiar to them. The <b>PanoImage</b> class knows how to respond to
mouse movements, keyboard presses, and screen redraws. Of course, it can
also do everything a <b>wxPanel</b> can do.
<p><b>Problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>
To my knowledge, there is no way to directly access <b>wxBitmap</b> data
in a platform-independent way, only <b>wxImage</b> data. Thus, manipulations
must be performed on a <b>wxImage</b> which is subsequently converted to
a <b>wxBitmap</b> for display. This conversion takes time. To make matters
worse, Helmut's library uses a 4-byte RGB format, while <b>wxImage</b>
uses a 3-byte format, so an additional 32- to 24-bit conversion must take
place. These conversions significantly slow down screen updates.</li>

<li>
Panning is limited in two ways. First, there is apparently no way to continually
receive mouse update events unless the mouse is moving. It is not enough
to be holding down the button, so users must hold down the button and constantly
move the mouse in order to pan around. Second, When the mouse leaves the
<b>PanoImage</b>
client area, mouse events are no longer processed, even if the button is
being held down. This means users can not move the mouse beyond the image
border and continue to pan.</li>
</ul>
<b>Future plans:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Parallelization:</b> I've been anxious for quite some time to help Helmut
parallelize his algorithms. Now, I am tempted to use the <b>wxThread</b>
model, but that means trying to combine more C with C++. It seems that
Helmut is partial to C, so I'm not sure how he would respond to the idea
of using a C++ toolkit to complete the Parallelization. I am reluctant
to touch Helmut's library without his approval because I want to make sure
I don't interfere with Panorama Tools development. I would rather build
a framework around what he has. Given this circumstance, there is still
room to parallelize the <b>PanoImage</b> object. One method is to do predictive
processing by preparing the next likely panorama frame in a separate thread
while the current is being displayed.</li>

<li>
<b>User/Automatic configuration:</b> <b>PanoImage</b> would time itself
and auto configure its pan and zoom rates to be speedy, if jerky, on the
system. Other configurations would detect the number of processors and
automatically parallelize. Users could also adjust the pan and zoom settings
through a dialog.</li>

<li>
<b>Better mouse control:</b> The mouse panning control was written in about
5 minutes. I think I need to spend more time on that aspect.</li>
