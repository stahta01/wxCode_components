XSTC has moved to:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nztexteditor/

The latest version of XSTC that was hosted on wxCode is located in SVN on the nztexteditor project.
It is still licenced the same as it was here, there was a typo in the source file license header.
Where the GPL notice was it said: "at your option any other version"
which should have read: "at your option any later version"
this has been corrected in the new repository.

The version that use to reside here is under tags/XSTC-old
XSTC has had a licensing change. It is still licensed under the wxWindows v3.1 license,
the GNU GPL dual license had been updated to the GPL 3.
This license update affects the version in trunk.
