CHANGES for version 6.4
ConfigStyle() will now call a built in theme from the style name
Updated documentation to be more clear and updated some out of date comments.
Added some overloaded functions so that objects passed to XSTC can be got back rather than just being deleted.
Changed the numbered bookmark toggle code so that it can be done programmincally as well as by user.
Fixed some bugs where incorrect input would cause memory leaks in some places.
Cleaned up the whitespace in the codebase to make it easier to read and checked for capitalization correctness.
Added an option to activate indentation highlighting for brace matching.
Minor bug fixes.

CHANGES for version 6.3
added exports for dll version, they where not all present.
fixed a minor bug in SaveFileX
updated stc build macros for wx-2.9
added a config root entry in the SetConfig function so that the configs can be a child of a larger config tree.

CHANGES for version 6.2
added missing language macros in GetEXTLexer so that languagees can be fully disabled
added new languages for scintilla 1.78
added MARK_LEFTRECT and MARK_AVAILABLE markers to the coloring system
fixed config system crash because variable initialization was after function call
moved the wraper macros to utils.h
changed XSTColor/ to XSTC/COLOR/ so that XSTC/EXT/ can be added to the config files
rewrote the extension config code to use the config class now
	removed: Prop1 setextconf() extset
	changed the code that used prop1 in SetLexerX() to check the extension of XFilename instead
changed the configuration database code to take a user created config instance instead of creating one for them.
added configuration based theme style functionality.
added bool argument to FoldSimple and FoldArrow so connection lines can be turned on/off
fixed the numbered bokmarks, now bokmarks show up on the correct line



CHANGES for version 6.1
total revamp of preprocesor macros, added config.h
added new languages to update to scintilla 1.77
made the config color code more robust
added a colordatabase option so color names can be used in the configs too
rewrote the load and save functions so they are more flexible
added matrixstyle()
added numbered bookmarks

CHANGES for version 6 final
reworked TrimTrailing() to work with large files better
changed the lexcolor functions to take class color variables. (strings)
  these are set in the colorstyle functions so they only need to be changed once
  for sake of resources, this is not incredibly intuitive. a few variables serve 
  everything. using the colorconf system will give more flexability, but this gives
  each language a consistent look and cuts the lines of code in lex.cpp by about 3/4
  of what it was.

added two colorstyle functions
added a registry config option
added marker 0 style to conf options
added text selection reset in ResetStyle()
removed all entries in constructor that are in ResetStyle() and called it instead.

CHANGES for version 5 beta

tab/spaces conversion fuction works now. TabSpace()

changes prop1 to an array of 10. (10 lexer properties can be set instead of 5)

added color config loading for all lexers

****************************************************************************************

CHANGES for version 4 beta

reworked the margin mapping function to only resize and map the margins
   because i couldn't get the code to act right for turning margins off at
   the same time. just use  SetMgnWidth() before MapMargins to achieve the
   same effect. keep in mind how Scintilla was designed, remapping may cause
   strange results with the margin drawing.

changed the foldmargin marker functions to color based on the current colorstyle

completed the colorstyle functions

added all the wxSTC supported lexcolor functions (not all finished yet)

reformed the keywords (they where messy and used \ changed to "" per line)

added color config system

added marker customizable for foldshape functions (markshape, markoutline)

fixed a stupid mistake, forgot to delete some instances, shouldn't be a problem now.

changed XSTC_DEF to concatonate the first underscore wxSTC_ instead of wxSTC

added macro to remove keyword functionality completely

added macro to deal with version differences between 2.6 and 2.7 for spice inno opal
      and caretLineBack and alphaLineBack functions

changed caretLineBack functions to macros and added alphaLineBack macros

****************************************************************************************
**********************************************************************

CHANGES for version 3 alpha
changed SetConfEXT() to take a filename or conf information (as it would be if a file where loaded)
added margin mapping and mapped margin resizing
   this does not yet work right, scintilla may not support it, but i have mapped numberline to other
   margins.
added all of the keyword lexer strings i could find from the scintilla source to keyword_sets struct
changed SetKeyStr to take two strings and it supports all of keyword_sets
added some things to the colorstyle functions and updated a few lexcolor functions
updated the constructor, doesn't set up behavior anymore, just internal settings
updated the documentation [doxy comments]
removed the hardcoded XCLASS macro from xstc.h (the sample now defines it in the project options)
added the option to compile both source files in a project and have them in the project directory 
  define XSTC_H_FLAT and the inclusion will look in the current directory rather than in include/wx
the extention conf system also supports porperties now
added a trimtrailing function, called by savefileX if trimspaces==true


****************************************************************************************

CHANGES for version alpha 2
added extention config file subsystem.
   this lets you overwrite the default behavior of what lexer is loaded based on the extention, the format is simple and strainght forward:
   extention_(underscore)lexer keyword or numeral
numbers are passed verbatim so you CAN send a bocus lexer number, no checks are done there.

****************************************************************************************
***********************************************************************

INITIAL release alpha 1
supports c++ lexer setup, coloring and fold margin setup as well as a simple marker.
the beginnings of the extention lexer work created.
dynamic linking of the margin and ui events to the current scintilla instnace.
bookmark margin works with a marker ready to go.
brace matching is done automatically
some scintilla behavior started in the constructor
