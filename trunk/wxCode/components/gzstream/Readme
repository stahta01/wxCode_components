wxWidgets:  2.5.1

wxGzipInputStream and wxGzipOutputStream, classes to read
and write gzips.

These classes where part of wxWidgets for a short time,
however they have now been obsoleted by improvements
to wxZlibInputStream and wxZlibOutputStream, which can
now read and write gzips themselves (the current CVS HEAD
supports that and wxWidgets 2.5.2 will be the first release
that will support it).

However, these classes provide a few features which
wxZlibInput/OutputStream do not (access to the header
fields), so I have made them available here in case anyone
needs to use them.

Extract the tarball under the contrib directory of your
wxWidgets directory, e.g.:

    cd wxWidgets/contrib
    tar xzvf ../../gzstream.tar.gz

and see wxWidgets/contrib/components/gzstream/install.txt
for more information.
