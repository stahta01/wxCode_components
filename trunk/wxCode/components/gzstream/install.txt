Using the Tarball
-----------------

Download:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxcode/gzstream.tar.gz?download

Extract the tarball under the contrib directory of your wxWidgets directory,
e.g.:

    cd wxWidgets/contrib
    tar xzvf ../../gzstream.tar.gz

To build the library on Windows use the appropriate makefile in
wxWidgets/contrib/components/gzstream/src. For the test program use the
makefiles in ../samples.

For other platforms, rerun configure in your wxWidgets build directory. A
contrib/components/gzstream subdirectory will be created with the makefiles
in it.

The library will be created in the same directory as wxWidgets' own libraries.

The documentation is available as Windows HTML help here:
../docs/htmlhelp/wxgz.chm. And in htb format here: ../docs/htb/wxgz.htb (for
viewing with wxWidgets' helpview). If you want plain html then unzip the htb.

Using CVS
---------

The generated makefiles and documentation are not present in the CVS, so
it is usually easier to use the tarball.

To generate the makefiles bakefile must be installed
(http://bakefile.sourceforge.net). Create (or add to) Bakefiles.local.bkgen
in your wxWidgets/build/bakefiles directory:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<bakefile-gen>
    <input>
        ../../contrib/components/*/*.bkl
        ../../contrib/components/*/*/*.bkl
        ../../contrib/components/*/*/*/*.bkl
    </input>
</bakefile-gen>

Then run bakefile_gen (from inside the wxWidgets/build/bakefiles dir):

    bakefile_gen -b '../../contrib/components/gzstream/*/*.bkl'

To build the documentation, tex2rtf must be installed
(http://www.wxwindows.org/tex2rtf/download.htm). The makefile is in
../docs/latex and assumes a unix-like make and utilities.

'make' with no arguments builds HTML in ../docs/html. For other formats you
can do:

    make htmlhelp   - requires MS Html Help Workshop
    make htb        - requires zip
    make winhelp    - requires MS Help Workshop
