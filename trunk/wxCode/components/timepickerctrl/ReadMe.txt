Below are instructions for building on various platforms.  If you experience problems, or if you have feedback, suggestions or comments, please email me at greenbreen@yahoo.com.  If you do email, please include the string "timepickerctrl" in the subject line so that I can filter the message to the appropriate folder.

DISCLAIMER:  Although I have attempted to make my code as high quality as possible, I am providing it AS IS without any warranty, included an implied warranty.  Use it at your own risk.

Linux:
To build in Linux, open a terminal and cd into the folder "timepickerctrl".  Then run "./configure"; then run "make"; then either run "make install" with root privileges, or run "sudo make install" and enter the appropriate password.  After this last command executes successfully, the component is installed and ready to be linked to by your programs.  On my system, the libraries are put in /usr/local/lib.  By default, the configure script generates a makefile for a shared unicode release library.  You can use "./configure --enable-"FEATURE or "./configure --disable-"FEATURE, where FEATURE is "unicode", "debug", or "shared" to control how the library is created.  For example, you can use "./configure --enable-debug --disable-shared" to generate a makefile for a static debug library.  Then use "make" and (sudo) "make install" to make and install it.  Other configure script options are available; search the configure script using search phrase "Optional Features" for more details.

Windows:
You should be able to build the libraries and included sample using the various project files (under the build folder) assuming you have the appropriate wxWidgets libraries built.  I tested the dsw file created by the bakefile system on Visual C++ 6 running on my Windows Vista system, and it worked once the wxWidgets dependencies were satisfied.  If you are having trouble, here are some things to check.  Make sure you have at least version 2.8 of wxWidgets installed.  Ensure that the WXWIN environmental variable is set and points to the root of your wxWidgets installation.  Make sure you have built the following wxWidgets libraries using the same configuration (Release, Debug, Unicode Release, etc) as the TimePickerCtrl project is set to:  base, core, and all libraries prefixed with "wx".  If you're still stuck after attempting these fixes, feel free to contact me.  Please include in your message what version of Windows you are using, what version of wxWidgets you are using, what project file(s) you are trying to build from, and any error messages you may be getting.

Other platforms:
I currently don't have access to other platforms.  The bakefile system generated build files that can potentially be used on other systems, so give it a try if you have access to these systems.  Please consider providing feedback about your experience if you do try it.
