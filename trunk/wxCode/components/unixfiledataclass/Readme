Description:
FileData is a class to encapsulate some *nix-specific things that wxWidgets (very
reasonably) ignores.  It has accessors for information about a file\"s permissions,
ownership etc, and methods to modify these where possible.  Unlike wxStat, it deals
correctly with symlinks.
 
None of this is rocket science, most methods just returning parts of statstruct. 
However I hope it saves some wheel-reinvention.
