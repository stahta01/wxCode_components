Description:
FileData is a class to encapsulate some *nix-specific things that wxWidgets (very
reasonably) ignores.  It has accessors for information about a file's permissions,
ownership etc, and methods to modify these where possible.  Unlike wxStat, it deals
correctly with symlinks.
 
None of this is rocket science, most methods just returning parts of statstruct. 
However I hope it saves some wheel-reinvention.



Release 1.1 fixes a bug in CanTHISUserRead() and CanTHISUserWrite().
The new version checks symlinks separately, as access() automatically dereferences these.
This resulted in wrong answers, especially in the case of broken symlinks.
I've also changed CanTHISUserRename() to check the parent dir for exec permission as well as write,
as without this the dir cannot be stat.ed.  This meant adding a CanTHISUserWriteExec() function.

Other minor additions are GetDeviceID() and GetUltimateDestination(); and GetPath() which is used internally.
