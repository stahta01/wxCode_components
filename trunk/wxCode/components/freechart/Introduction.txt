							I. About.
	wxFreeChart is the free crossplatform chart library based on wxWidgets.

	wxFreeChart licensed under wxWindows library license.

							II. Requirments.
	wxFreeChart requires wxWindows library version 2.8.0 or later (work with wxWidgets 2.6.x not tested).

							III. Chart types.
	wxFreeChart supports following types of charts:
	1. Line or histogram charts based on xy coordinates.
	2. Histogram category charts.
	3. OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) financial charts
	4. Pie charts.
	5. Date/Time based line or histogram charts.
	6. Bubble charts, based on zyz coordinates.
	7. Layered bar charts.
	8. Stacked bar charts.
	9. Statistical charts with std-deviations, etc.
	10. Gantt charts.

							IV. Basic concepts.
		wxFreeChart is object-oriented charting library with model-controller-view design.
	First class that you need is Chart. It contains plot, chart title, and other attributes. Chart
	delegates drawing operations to Plot, Plot delegates to dataset renderers.
	Plot class glues axes (if any), datasets, legend, data markers, etc.
	Dataset classes contains data to be drawn. There are XY datasets, OHLC datasets, date/time datasets
	(for data linked with date/time values), category datasets. They are only interface to get data values.
	Data drawing performed by dataset renderers, like XYRenderers, OHLC renderers (Bars or candlesticks),
	histogram renderers.
		wxChartPanel is wxWidgets window containing chart.
		Other classes include Legend, Marker, AreaBackground, ColorScheme, Symbol.
	Legend performs legend drawing, contains attributes like, legend position, font, etc.
	Marker is base class for data markers, like point markers, line markers, range markers. It is still
	work in progress.
	AreaBackground is helper class for drawing rectangular areas. It is used to draw chart, plot backgrounds,
	bars in bar charts. GradientAreaBackground can be used to create gradient effects.
	ColorScheme is colours collection for pie plots, etc.
	Symbol is base class for symbols drawn on legends and xy points.

	FIXME: write more.
							V. Known issues.
	- Work with wxWidgets 2.6.x not tested.
	- I can test only wxMSW (on Windows XP, Windows Vista), and wxGTK (on Linux).
	- Antialiasing doesn't works.
	- Pie plots is very ugly, and must be cleaned up or rewritten.
	- Transparency not implemented. Needed for area/histogram charts with overlaying areas/histograms, etc.
	- Too much header files.

	FIXME: write more.
