 WebUpdate component info
 ------------------------

 Website: http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate
 Version: 1.0

 Description:
 A complete, open source, cross-platform update solution for any type of application.
 Provides a easily-integrable, small application which connects to a web server and
 shows the updated packages to the user (supports multiple packages) and let him download
 and install them.
 Reliable downloads are granted using MD5 checksums. Local updates (e.g. updates to be taken
 from a CD-ROM or any other device) are supported, too.
 The program is highly configurable using XML and XRC files.
 For a complete list of the features of WebUpdate, look at the WebUpdate docs.



 Installation
 ------------

 When building on win32, you can use the makefiles in the BUILD folder.
 The USE_HTTPENGINE=0/1 option can be used to compile with/without the
 wxHttpEngine component.

 When building on a Linux/GNU-based system, type

  cd build
  ./configure
  make

 Type "./configure --help" for more info.
 The --with-httpengine/--without-httpengine option can be used to compile
 with/without the wxHttpEngine component.
 NOTE: linux version requires wx2.7 or higher due to a bug in wx networking
       code which affects all wx2.6 versions.

 For any problem, feel free to contact frm@users.sourceforge.net
