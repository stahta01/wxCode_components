 EXAMPLE OF A DATA FILE FOR THE SIMPLE PROGRAM v1.0.0
 ====================================================
 
 This is the example of a generic data file required by your program to run.
 This file needs to be updated when updating the program to a new version and
 in fact if you try to run the simple v.1.0.0 program and update it, you'll see
 that the WebUpdater replaces both the executable program and this data file.
