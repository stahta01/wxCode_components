   Purpose:     a simple DTD to validate local update script
   Version:     1.0

   This Document Type Definition (DTD) is for the update scripts that reside
   in your program's folder and which just list the installed packages.
   This file should make easier to check validity of the
   scripts you write and it should also be as a simple reference guide for the 
   update script format.

   The local XML scripts which follows this DTD should include the following
   line before the <webupdate> root tag:

      <!DOCTYPE webupdate PUBLIC "-//WebUpdate//DTD WebUpdater 1.0//EN" 
            "http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate/local.dtd">

   which just tells to XML parser that the XML file follows the WebUpdater DTD v1.0.
	 
   Also remember to validate your XML files against this DTD before mailing for
   problems about your scripts: WebUpdate component is not responsible for
   unwanted behaviours coming from malformed update scripts !

<!-- WEBUPDATE tag: this is the root of the script file.
                    Requires the 'version' property which must be set to the
                    same version of this DTD file (you can find it at the
                    beginning of this document).

<!-- APPNAME tag: specifies the name of the application being updated.
-->
<!ELEMENT appname (#PCDATA)>


<!-- APPFILE tag: specifies the name of the executable file for the application
                  being updated. This field is used to restart the application 
 		  after the update process. To keep this field cross-platform you
                  should not specify the extension which will be added by the
                  WebUpdater application (.EXE for win32; nothing for unix).
-->
<!ELEMENT appfile (#PCDATA)>


<!-- XRC: specifies the name of the XRC resource file. 
          If this tag is not specified, then "webupdatedlg.xrc" will be used.
          Can be overridden by the "xrc" command line option.
-->
<!ELEMENT xrc (#PCDATA)>


<!-- RES: specifies the name of the dialog resource to load from the XRC file.
          You can also avoid to use this tag and use the "res" option of the
          WebUpdater program instead.
          Can be overridden by the "res" command line option.
-->
<!ELEMENT res (#PCDATA)>


<!-- RESTART: can be "0" or "1" and indicates if the updated application should
              be restarted when WebUpdater will be closed or not.
              This tag is optional; default value is "0".
              Can be overridden by the "restart" command line option.
-->
<!ELEMENT restart (#PCDATA)>


<!-- SAVELOG: can be "0" or "1" and indicates if the WebUpdater should save a
              a log file for debugging purposes.
              This tag is optional; default value is "0".
              Can be overridden by the "savelog" command line option.
-->
<!ELEMENT savelog (#PCDATA)>


<!-- REMOTEURI tag: specifies where the WebUpdate remote script is stored.
                    This tag is optional in the sense that it can be missing from
                    the XML local script but in this case it *must* be present in
                    the WebUpdater command line options since this is a required info.
                    If this tag is present and also the "uri" command line option is
                    given to WebUpdater, then the command line option will override this
                    value.
-->
<!ELEMENT remoteuri (#PCDATA)>


<!-- KEYWORDS tag: specifies additional keywords used by WebUpdate to substitute
                                  $(xxxx) strings in the remote script. See remote.dtd for more info
								  about keyword substitution.
                                  The keywords must be in the format:
								   key1="value1",key2="value2",key3="value3" ...
								In the sample above, the following substitution will be performed
								
								$(key1)  => value1
								$(key2)  => value2
								$(key3)  => value3
								....
								
								Note: this tag is parsed after that all the standard keywords (see remote.dtd)
								has been initialized so that you can override them (e.g. using 
								programdir=c:\programdir\loaded\by\registry, the WebUpdater will
								use that value to substitute $(programdir) keys...).
								
								Note #2: this is the only tag in a local XML script where keyword substitution
								is performed: i.e. the following is allowed and does what you think:
									        <keywords>addondir=$(programdir)\addons</keywords>
