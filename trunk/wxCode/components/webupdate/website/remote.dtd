   Name:        remote.dtd
   Purpose:     a simple DTD to validate update script
   Version:     1.0

   This Document Type Definition (DTD) is for the update scripts that you put
   in your webserver. This file should make easier to check validity of the
   scripts you write and it should also be as a simple reference guide for the 
   update script format.

   The remote XML scripts which follows this DTD should include the following
   line before the <webupdate> root tag:

      <!DOCTYPE webupdate PUBLIC "-//WebUpdate//DTD WebUpdater 1.0//EN" 
            "http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate/remote.dtd">

   which just tells to XML parser that the XML file follows the WebUpdater DTD v1.0.

   I suggest you to look at the following files as examples of WebUpdate scripts:
   
     http://wxcode.sf.net/components/webupdate/script1.xml
     http://wxcode.sf.net/components/webupdate/script2.xml
	 
   Also remember to validate your XML files against this DTD before mailing for
   problems about your scripts: WebUpdate component is not responsible for
   unwanted behaviours coming from malformed update scripts !

   NOTE ABOUT THE SPECIAL '//' CHAR SEQUENCE: sometimes you need to specify in
   one of the <actions> subtags the path separator in a platform-indepedent way.
   This can be done using twice the forward slash character: that sequence will be
   translated (only in <action> subtags!) as '/' on Unix-based systems and as '\' on
   win32 systems.
   If you need to write the '//' sequence and you don't want it to be substituted you need
   to write three times the forward slash: '///' will be intepreted as '//'.

   NOTE ABOUT "KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION": in this context, by "keyword substitution" 
   we mean the process of replacing those strings in the form $(...) with values
   defined at compile-time & run-time in the program which downloads this script file.
   Keyword substitution is performed only in the text content of those tags whose  
   description explicitely state it.
   The list of keywords which can be used is:
   
   - folders:   
     $(programdir) = the folder where the WebUpdater executable is placed; ends with '//' special character.
     $(downloaddir) = the folder where the downloaded files are placed; ends with '//' special character.
     $(tempdir) = a temporary folder already existing and thus (probably) non-empty; ends with '//' special character.
     $(newtempdir) = a temporary folder which has been created by the WebUpdate and thus is empty; ends with '//' special character.
     $(localdir) = the folder where the local XML script is located; ends with '//' special character.
     $(remotedir) = the folder where the remote XML script is located; ends with '//' special character.

   - files:
     $(updater) = the path of the file and the filename of the WebUpdater program
     $(program) = the path of the file and the filename of the program to update
                  (the filename is taken from the local script)
     $(localxml) = the path of the file and the filename (as URI) of the local XML script (acquired when parsing the local script).
     $(remotexml) = the path of the file and the filename (as URI) of the remote XML script (taken from the local XML script).
   
   - names:   
     $(appname) = the name of the application (as loaded by the local script)
     $(updatername) = the name of the WebUpdater application
     $(exe) = the postfix of an executable file for the current platform 
              (i.e .EXE on win32, nothing on other platforms)

   - command names:
     $(cp) = the copy command (i.e. 'cp -f' on unix, 'cmd.exe /c copy /y' on windows)
     $(mv) = the move command (i.e. 'mv -f' on unix, 'cmd.exe /c move /y' on windows)
     $(cd) = the change directory command (i.e. 'cd' on unix, 'cmd.exe /c cd' on windows)
     $(mkdir) = the make directory command (i.e. 'mkdir' on unix, 'cmd.exe /c mkdir' on windows)
     
     NOTE: the commands above have the aesthetic disadvantage that they open a console window when they are used for example as:
               <run cmd="$(cp)" args="c:\from\* c:\to" />
           and thus you should try to use the <copy>, <mkdir> actions instead.
   
   - miscellaneous:
     $(pid) = the process ID of the updater program
	 
   - these are available only after the relative tags:
     $(latest-version) = the version of the package (available only after <latest-version>)
     $(thisfile) = the name of the file of this package (available only after <uri>)
     $(id) = the ID name of this package (available only after <package id="">)

     NOTE: this action has a special behaviour which allow to update
     the WebUpdater application itself. In fact, when it founds a compressed file which
     is named "$(updatername)$(exe)", then it outputs the file as "_$(updatername)$(exe)".
     This is because the WebUpdater cannot replace itself and thus any try to overwrite the
     WebUpdater executable would fail.
     The app which uses WebUpdater should look for filenames called "_$(updatername)$(exe)" 
     and rename them to "$(updatername)$(exe)".
