<center>by Francesco Montorsi</center>

\section features WebUpdate features
- Open source (\ref http://www.wxwidgets.org/licence.php "wxWidgets-licensed").
- Cross-platform (using \ref http://www.wxwidgets.org "wxWidgets").
- \link nonwxsample Ability to update any kind of application (also not wxWidgets-based). \endlink
- Easily integrable in your application (needs only few modifications).
- Small (the binary for win32 distributed at 
\link http:// \endlink is only XXX Kb)
- Handles an arbitrary number of packages.
- Allows platform-dependent set of installation actions for each package.
- Extensible GUI: even its GUI can be modified without recompiling the
application (using the wxWidgets XRC system). This also means that you can
choose among various GUI masks (some are better for simple programs with
few packages, others are better for big programs with many packages) or 
just create your own.
- Extensible configuration files: the local & remote XML files (see below 
for an explanation of this terminology) allows you to configure the behaviour 
of the updater.
- Extensible actions: the actions which are taken when downloading each
package can be chosen by the programmer who writes the remote XML file and
updater allows you to define new actions just deriving a C++ class.
- Ability to update itself.
- MD5 checks on the downloaded file to avoid data corruption.
- Ability to download the updates & the remote XML file from any source:
World Wide Web is the typical location but the WebUpdater can be configured
to use the packages stored in a removable device (CD, DVD, floppies or whatelse).
- Allows many properties to be set for each package: the 'importance', the
platform which it targets, the description, \b its dependencies (on other packages)
- The DTDs allows you to easily check your XML files.


\section howtostart How to start...

Don't start to dig in the doxygen documentation of the classes & functions of
WebUpdate; you probably will never need to do that !
Just read \ref tutorial and enjoy WebUpdate ;-)

\section defs Basic WebUpdate concepts
Before using this component, you need to know some few definitions of the terms
used in all WebUpdate documentation:
- the WebUpdate project provides both a library and an executable, which is called
'<strong>WebUpdater</strong>' or just '<strong>updater</strong>'.
The library is used only for some advanced things and for simple programs you will
typically need to use only the 'updater' copying the executable file in your
program's folder. For more info about the design of the WebUpdate component, look at the 
\ref faq "FAQ page"...
- a 'package' is a set of files which have in common their function (or maybe their
location in the program's folder structure) and are packaged
in a single archive. A 'remote package' is an archive hosted in the webserver for
download. A 'local package' is a package which is installed in the user's system 
(typically 'installed' means 'uncompressed').
The C++ classes used by WebUpdate to work on local & remote packages are
wxWebUpdateLocalPackage and wxWebUpdatePackage, respectively.
- a 'download' is the compressed file which holds the remote package files.
A single remote package can have many downloads; typically one per targeted platform
even if a single download can be used by more than a single platform.
The C++ class used to store a 'download' is wxWebUpdateDownload.
- an 'action' is one of the command to execute after the complete download of a
package (i.e. after the download of the package's 'download' for the current platform).
There are two predefined actions: wxWebUpdateActionRun and wxWebUpdateActionExtract.
Their base class is wxWebUpdateAction. You can define your own customized actions
deriving a new class from wxWebUpdateAction.
- the 'local XML script' is the XML file which contains the configuration settings
for the WebUpdater application and also the versions and the list of the local
packages currently installed. The C++ class for local XML scripts is
wxWebUpdateLocalXMLScript.
- the 'remote XML script' is slightly more complex rather than the local XML script
because it contains all the info about the remote packages in the webserver
(specially their versions) and the info about their installation.
The C++ class for remote XML scripts is wxWebUpdateXMLScript.


\section howto_integrate How to integrate WebUpdate in your application
It's quite easy to use WebUpdate in your programs following these simple steps:

1) <strong>Plan your "update strategies"</strong>: do you need more than a single
package ? Which files will belong to each package ? Which format are you going to
use for your packages: simple archives (ZIP, TAR.GZ, ...) or installers (MSI, RPM,
DEB) ? Which actions will you need to perform such updates ?

Try to keep things as simple as possible; also you should not think to the
action tags as a complete set of installer directives.
In fact, if you need special or platform-dependent actions then you should
use some kind of script in the downloaded file (MSI, RPM, DEB all provide a much
more complete set of possible actions) and then use the WebUpdater just to run
those scripts / installers.

Another thing to consider is: how much often will you make a new release ?
If you often make new releases then you should try to keep the files which need
to be updated separed (i.e. in a different package) from those files which instead
probably won't need updates. In this way the packages which will be downloaded by
the user will be smaller and thus updates will be faster (and the user happier).

On the other hand, if you often make releases or have few time to do the packaging,
and your program is not so big, you should consider to create a single package for
each platform which will work both as installer for the user who download your program
for the first time and also as update for the user using WebUpdater.



2) <strong>Write your 'local.xml' file</strong>: this is the simplest XML used
by WebUpdate; it looks like:

\verbatim

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE webupdate PUBLIC "-//WebUpdate//DTD WebUpdater 1.0//EN" 
	"http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate/local.dtd">

<webupdate version="1.0">

  <!-- some settings about the application to update... -->
  <appname>AppName</appname>
  <appfile>myprogram</appfile>
  
  <!-- ...about the XRC resource name to use for webupdater... -->
  <dlgxrc>wxWebUpdateDlg</dlgxrc>
  
  <!-- ...where to find the list of updated packages ... -->
  <remoteuri>http://myserver/updates/list.xml</remoteuri>
  
  <!-- ...the list of the local packages -->
  <local-package id="core">
    <version>1.0.0</version>
  </local-package>
  <local-package id="addon1">
    <version>1.0.0</version>
  </local-package>
  <local-package id="addon2">
    <version>1.0.0</version>
  </local-package>
  
  ...
</webupdate>
\endverbatim

For the complete reference to the tags that you can use in this XML file, you should
look at \ref http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate/local.dtd 
(even if you don't know the DTD syntax it should be quite easy to
understand what is allowed and what is not...). 




3) <strong>Write your 'remote.xml' file</strong>: this is a bit more complex and
contains all the important info about the updated packages. It looks like:

\verbatim

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE webupdate PUBLIC "-//WebUpdate//DTD WebUpdater 1.0//EN" 
	"http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate/remote.dtd">

<webupdate version="1.0">
   <package id="simple">
      <latest-version importance="high">2.0.3</latest-version>
      <latest-download>
			<uri>http://myserver/updates/simple.zip</uri>
			<platform name="msw"/>	
			<actions>
				<extract file="$(thisfile)" where="$(programdir)"/>
			</actions>
	  </latest-download>
      <latest-download>
			<uri>http://myserver/updates/simple.tar.gz</uri>
			<platform name="gtk"/>
			<actions>
   				<run/>
       		</actions>
	  </latest-download>
	  <description>This is a simple package with two downloads !</description>
   </package>

   ...
</webupdate>
\endverbatim

Like for the local scripts, for the complete reference to the tags that you can 
use in this XML file, you should look at  
\ref http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/webupdate/remote.dtd . 



4) <strong>Create your packages</strong>: now, you should create the archives/installers
that you planned to use as update packages. WebUpdate does not require any special hack
to be included in your packages (like the filelist or other ugly things).
It just requires that, if you want to use the <extract> action, you use one of the
wxWidgets-supported archive types (look at remote.dtd for more info).

After the creation of the packages, you should just upload them in the right places.
Also take in count that while you are testing the update system you can put the packages
in your hard disk and then use in the <remoteuri> and <uri> tags of the local & remote
XML scripts local URIs (e.g. <uri>file:c:/simple.zip</uri>) instead of the remote ones;
this allows you to test the update system also when you are offline and, most important,
to test it quickly (since downloads are usually slower than hard disk accesses !).



5) <strong>Modify your program to use WebUpdater</strong>: this is the 'real' integration
step. The changes to your app are very small:
- somewhere (typically in the handler of a menu command) you should put an execute
istruction to run 'webupdater(.exe)'. You can see how to do this using wxWidgets in the
WebUpdate samples.
- just after the call to 'webupdater(.exe)' you should add an exit istruction; that is,
just after that your program has run the updater your program must also exit 
(this is because the updater will probably need to override your program's executable
or other files locked by your program... see the \ref faq for more info).

Then, just compile WebUpdater (or download its binary distribution)
and put the executable file in your program's root folder. That's it !



5) <strong>Test your update system</strong>: just run your program and see if it
correctly runs the WebUpdater. Once the webupdater is running you should verify
that your application did exit. Then you can test your XML remote script
(the local script is loaded immediately when webupdater starts), the remote
packages and the installation actions just acting as the user of your program would do.



This should be enough to use the WebUpdate component.
For a soft approach you could also prefer to look directly to the samples of WebUpdate.
In this case first look at \ref samples page.

\page samples The samples of WebUpdate

All the samples of WebUpdate comes with at least two different versions.
This is because you need the old version of the sample to test the WebUpdater
and I need the newer version for making the update package ;-)

   Why it does not provide a library which can be linked to the application to update
   so that I can ship a single executable ?

2) Why using XML for the scripts ?
