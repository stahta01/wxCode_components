Requirements
============
To build successfully you need at least wxWidgets 2.4.2. Either get it 
via a package system (e.g. Debian) or build it according their instructions.

To improve the functionality the following optional patches for wxWidgets
may be applied (see download "Patches.zip" or get them from wxWidgets site).
Before you patch decide first which you want and then apply them in
increasing patch number order.


wxGTK

Generel building rules
======================
If got wxWidgets from a package or if you built it into the standard 
location, everything is fine. Otherwise you _have_ to set the $WXSTABLE 
environment variable to point to the base directory of wxWidgets 
(i.e. "/usr/src/wxWidgets" then "WXSTABLE=/usr/src/wxWidgets").

If you want to build any development target don't forget to set the 
environment variable WXDEVEL (i.e. "C:\Devel\wxWidgetsDev" then
"WXDEVEL=C:\Devel\wxWidgetsDev").


Linux (wxGTK, wxUniv/GTK)
-------------------------
Use "make" for the release version, "make debug" for the debug version.
For wxUniv use make "make univdebug" and don't forget variable WXDEVEL.


MacOS (wxMAC)
-------------
???


Windows (wxMSW, wxUniv/MSW)
---------------------------
There is a VC++ project file which requires the environment variable 
WXSTABLE pointing to the correct locations (i.e. "C:\Devel\wxWidgets" then
"WXSTABLE=C:\Devel\wxWidgets").


Building on other ports
-----------------------
There is currently no support to build on other ports. If you are able to deduct
how to build on your platform it would be nice if you submit them to the project.


Patch desctiptions
==================
[ 681893 ] Combobox in toolbar (only for wxUniv and other universal ports)
Comboboxes within toolbars aren't supported under wxUniv. This patch adds it.

[ 748469 ] wxNotebook::HitTest for wxMSW and wxUniv
Right clicking on a notebook tab brings up a context menu when this patch is
applied, otherwise nothing happens. If this patch is applied to make it
usable the define NOTEBOOK_HITTEST in setup.h has to be set to 1 (Only usable
on wxMSW and wxUniv).

[ 749749 ] wxFileConfig doesn't allow for no appName (only for wxUniv and
other universal ports)
On wxUniv wxFileConfig requires a config parameter. The define
APPNAME_FILECONFIG in setup.h does a workaround, therefore this patch isn't
very important.

[ 766424 ] Index search with keyword
Index search is much faster than the content search. If this patch is applied
to make it usable the define HELP_INDEX_KEYWORD in setup.h has to be set to 1.

[ 769552 ] SetFocus sets now lastFocused
This patch fixes the SetFocus function so it does work. Simply apply this
patch.

[ 781346 ] Printing backport from head
The printing in wxWidgets 2.4.2 is not usable so to be able to print this
patch has to be applied. Simply apply it.

[ 830049 ] RegKey DevelValue produces unnecessary log message
Remove an unnecessary wxLog message when deleting a nonexistent value (only
on wxMSW)

[ 830050 ] Clipboard support in wxUniv
Clipboard is available but disabled in wxUniv (only wxUniv)

[ 863847 ] Uses correct font in GTK
On wxGTK always a proportional font is used without this patch (only wxGTK)

[ 865500 ] wxNotebook: No correct current page after DeletePage
On wxGTK after deleting a page which is before the current page always the
wrong current page is returned (only wxGTK)

[ 888042 ] Access to menu keys under wxGTK
Predefined shortcut keys under wxGTK aren't accessable by the menu even if
they are disabled.
