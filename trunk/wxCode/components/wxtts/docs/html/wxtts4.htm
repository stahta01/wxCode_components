<H2>wxTTS bugs, problems and omissions</H2>
<P>
The following work is still needed or can be considered:<P>
<UL>

<LI> wxFreePhone needs further testing and debugging for memory problems in cleanup;
<LI> more error checking and reporting required;
<LI> (wx)FreePhone code could use rewriting for clarity, perhaps using a string class;
<LI> need control over how numbers, dates etc. are pronounced;
<LI> further samples would be useful, for example for reading large texts (which will
need to break text into chunks and wait for a chunk to be read before reading the
next one);
<LI> custom voices could be maintained in wxMbrola, with a mapping between voice name
and voice parameters;
<LI> a wxTTS class could be created to unify wxFreePhone and wxMbrola;
<LI> some SAPI compatibility could be attempted;
<LI> need to produce standard dialogs that can be invoked to adjust parameters;
<LI> could have a second (customisable) dictionary, perhaps with a dialog to allow addition of
words in a friendly manner (e.g. you have a selection of phonemes which you can
put together, with a preview - maybe even a soundex-like algorithm to make an initial
guess of what the phonemes should be);
<LI> need to write further makefiles, e.g. for Gnu-Win32, BC++;
<LI> need ports to other platforms.
</UL>
