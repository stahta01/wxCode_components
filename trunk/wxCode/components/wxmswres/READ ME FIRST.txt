wxMSWResources, by Ernesto Rangel Dallet - midnight_software@yahoo.com.mx

************ Introduction *******************

This is the wxMSWResources class, a convenient way of working with resources with wxWidgets in MSW.
The main goal of the class is to allow you to create apps that do not require ANY external files, 
like .mo catalogs, images, etc.
It automatically creates a unique temp folder, allows you to extract resources of any kind 
to it from the .exe´s module, and deletes them all when the app is closing.
It also allows you to access resource data directly.
Make shure you check out the sample app "MyPics" provided as a Visual Studio.net 2003 
project to learn its usage.


************ IMPORTANT NOTE: READ THIS BEFORE POSTING "IT DOESNT LINK!!" ***************

Both the sample project and the library projects, are configured to use static linking 
to msvcr71.dll (eg. setting Multi-Threaded (/MT) instead of Multi-Threaded DLL (/MD) in VS.NET 2003),
if you built wxWidgets using dynamic linking (the default), make shure you change the 
project settings for both projects accordingly or youll get 1,000,000 linker errors.

Why static linking? well, the main goal of this code is to enable you to write .exe-file-only apps,
and having to distribute msvcr71.dll along with you app is kinda the oposite thing :)
NE way, if you prefeer dynamic linking, please change the project settings as described above. 

************* USAGE ***********************
1.- Open the Visual Studio.NET 2003 solution in the build directory.
2.- (If appropiate) change the linker settings (SEE ABOVE) for both the library & app projects
3.-  and compile everything on both release & debug configs
4.- run the app on debug mode, watch the code, etc.
5.- to use in your own apps: 
I created a .lib project to conform to wxCode standards, and you can of course
use wxMSWResources like this (linking to wxmswres.lib), but since were talking 
about a single (not too large class), i suggest you just add the files wxmswres.h and 
wxmswres.cpp to you own projects.

I Hope you find this code usefull.
