TO DO:
======
- unicode support ?


Future enhancements:
====================
- long term: wxTreeListCtrl is mostly a wrapper around wxTreeListMainWindow (a glorified wxScrolledWindow), would it make sense to use wxTreeListMainWindow directly ?
    - avoid having to propagate events in OnMouse, OnScroll
    - by default wxScrolledWindow methods are available
- very very long term: unification between wxTreeListCtrl, wxGrid, wxDataViewCtrl, wxTreeMultiCtrl, wxTreeCtrl....
