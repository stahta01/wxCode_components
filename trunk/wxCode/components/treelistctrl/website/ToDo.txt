TO DO:
======
- add sort support in sample
- abstract cell editor to allow multiple pickers a la wxPack / wxFormBuilder
- review virtual support with regard to attributes


Future enhancements:
====================
- does wxDataViewCtrl not offer similar functionality ?
- long term: wxTreeListCtrl is mostly a wrapper around wxTreeListMainWindow (a glorified wxScrolledWindow), would it make sense to use wxTreeListMainWindow directly ?
    - avoid having to propagate events in OnMouse, OnScroll
    - by default wxScrolledWindow methods are available
- very very long term: unification between wxTreeListCtrl, wxGrid / wxDataViewCtrl, wxTreeCtrl / wxTreeMultiCtrl (now in wxWidgets), ....
