Requirements:
=============
- To build successfully you need at least wxWidgets 2.6.1 (stable).


Generel building rules:
=======================
- First build or get the wxWidgets libraries however this is done on your platform.
- you can simply run 'make' (wxWidgets should be properly installed, i.e.
  'wx-config' should be in the path)
  Use "make" for the release version, "make debug" for the debug version,
  "make univdebug" for the univ debug version.
- There is also a CodeBlock project file, requiring the global variable 'wx' to
  Be set (Menu "Settings / Global Variables"; 'base' is enough)


Building on Unix (wxGTK, wxUniv)
================================
- no specific instructions


Building on Windows (wxMSW, wxUniv)
===================================
- There is a VC++ project file which requires the environment variable WXWIN
  pointing to the correct locations (i.e. "C:\Devel\wxWidgets" then
  "WXWIN=C:\Devel\wxWidgets").
- Or if you have MSYS+MINGW installed you can simply run 'make'


Building on other ports
=======================
- There is currently no support to build on other ports. If you are able to 
  build on your platform it would be nice to send the details to the project
