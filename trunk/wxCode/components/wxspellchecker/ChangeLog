2005-03-20 : Changed makefiles to use the first wx-config in the path.
             (Aspell) Upgraded Aspell library to 0.60.2
             (wxWidgets) Upgraded to wxWidgets 2.5.4
             Fixed some segmentation faults when trying to use an unintialized Aspell engine
             wxWidgets sample now disables unintialized spell check engines

2004-05-13 : Moved the DictionaryWizard into the tools directory to try and keep the library size down

2004-05-11 : Added DictionaryWizard to help download available dictionaries for the spell check engine

2004-04-11 : (Sample) Removed Outlook-like and Sentry-like dialog classes and made XML resource replacements.  The Mozilla-like dialog class was kept as an example of deriving from wxSpellCheckDialogInterface.
             Sample now allows directly presenting the personal dictionary dialog
             Sample now allows for saving the wxTextCtrl contents to a file

2004-04-11 : (Aspell) Aspell engine now uses the generic PersonalDictionary class.  This will probably change to Aspell's internal personal dictionary support if/when Aspell's API includes a way to remove words from the personal dictionary.
