# Purpose:       changes the user of a CVS local repository altering all 'Root' files.
#                The old 'Root' files are renamed as 'OldRoot'.
#
# NOTE: CVS works storing the user who checked-out the local repository in a file called
#       'Root' which is present inside all 'CVS' folders which typically appear as hidden
#       in the CVS clients.
#       This means that you don't have to specify the user (and all other info which are
#       included in the CVSROOT) each time you perform a CVS operation on the repository;
#       however, this also means that normally you cannot checkout a module with a username 
#       and then do operations on that module with another username.
#       This script just makes this possible changing the username in CVS-controlled files.


# $1 = the name of the folder where Root must be changed
# $2 = the old user name
# $3 = the new user name
