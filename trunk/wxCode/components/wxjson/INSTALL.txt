wxJSON INSTALL
--------------
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse
and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is
completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to
programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an
ideal data-interchange language.


Installation - win32
--------------------

When building on win32, you can use the makefiles in the 'build/' folder using the
WX_DIR, WX_DEBUG, WX_UNICODE and WX_SHARED to match your wxWidgets build.
Examples:

> nmake -fmakefile.vc WX_DIR=c:\path\to\my\wxWidgets WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1
> make -fmakefile.bcc WX_DIR=c:\path\to\my\wxWidgets WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1


Installation - borland BCC 5.5
------------------------------

For building the library using the free command-line tools from Borland
use the following commands:

> set BCCDIR=c:\path_to_your_bcc55_installation 
> set WXWIN=c:\path_to_your_wxWidgets_installation
> make -fmakefile.bcc WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1

you have to set the WX_UNICODE, WX_DEBUG and WX_SHARED variables in order
to meet your wxWidgets installation.

To run the test application you have to copy or move the 'test.exe' file
in the top-level directory.
The 'test.exe' file should be located in a subfolder of the 'build/'
folder; its name depends on the build type.
For example, it could be 'build/bccmsw/' or 'build/bccmswd/'
After you have copied or moved the file, type:

> test.exe


Installation - unix
-------------------
When building on a Linux/GNU-based system, type the usual:

  ./configure
  make

to build against the default build of wxWidgets (the one listed as 'default'
by wx-config --list). Type "./configure --help" for more info.

In order to run the test application you may need to specify the
path to the wxJSON library. If the test app cannot be run for linker's
errors not founding the 'libwxjson-(some_version).so' file then
you have to set the library path:

# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib

Next, type the test command:

# ./test


Installation - unix-like systems
--------------------------------

If you own a unix-like system and all other build systems fail, you can try
the 'last resort'.
In the top level directory of the wxJSON distribution you will find the
'makefile.unx' file which was edited by hand and extensively commented.
You have to edit this file in order to meet your system.


Installation - checked-out sources
----------------------------------

If you do not want to wait until the official release of the library, and
want to be always up-to-date you can get the wxJSON sources by
directly accessing the Subversion repository on SF.
On a Unix system use the following command:

 $ svn co https://wxcode.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wxcode/trunk/wxCode/components/wxjson


Note that you have to create your own project file or makefile in order
to compile the library or you can use the 'bakefile' tool to create
some of them. See the documentation on the wxCode website:
http://wxcode.sourceforge.net


Installation - Do you really need it?
-------------------------------------

The wxJSON is made of only three source files and four header files.
If you want to install the library and also want to build it for the
standard options shared/static, debug/release, UTF8/unicode you end
up with several different builds.
Worse, if you distribute your application dynamically linked you have
to supply a binary copy of the library or have to let your user to 
build it in addition to build wxWidgets itself.
This makes your app to depend on another external library in addition
to wxWidgets.

The library itself is only 124 KB in release mode and 420 KB in debug
mode so it is more simple to just include it in your own sources and
let the compiler of your application to compile the library itself.
You just have to copy the three source files located in the 'src/'
subfolder in your own source folder and the four header files
located in the 'include/' subfolder in your own header folder.
Be sure to preserve the 'wx/' folder under the 'include/'.
Next add the three source '.cpp' files to your project and you are done.

This way, your application does not depend on wxJSON because it is
embedded in your app and you do not need to deal with 'makefiles',
'bakefiles', 'configs' and so on.
