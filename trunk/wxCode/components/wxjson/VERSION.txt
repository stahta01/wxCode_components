VERSIONS
--------

The versioning scheme of the wxJSON library is much like the standard
one used for Linux applications/libraries.

Version number is made of three decimal digits that represents:

- the major release
- the minor release
- the bug-fix release

For example: '0.2.1' stands for:

 major: 0
 minor: 2
 bug-fix: 1

A change in the major release introduces incompatibility between the library
and the applications that use it.
In other words, when the major version changes, the author had
introduced a change in the API: it could be a change in the function
names or in the type and number of function's parameters.

The minor release changes when a new class or a new function is added
to the library but it remains compatible with the past.
Applications can upgrade to any later minor-version without need to
change the sources.

The bug-fix release is done when some bugs are fixed.
The library remains compatible with the past and no new feature
was added.
