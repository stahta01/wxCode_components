\section json_ver11_wxw29 Compatible with both wxWidgets 2.8 and 2.9

The new version is compatible with both wxWidgets 2.8 and 2.9.
Tried using wxGTK 2.8.10 and 2.9.1 (daily snapshot wxWidgets-2009-10-17)


\section json_ver11_asfunct A new AsXxxxxx() function

The \c wxJSONValue::AsXxxxx() function can be used to get the value of
a JSON value but you have first to check if it is of the expected type.
So you would probably write code like this one:

\code
  wxJSONValue v["key"] = 100;
  int i;
  if ( v["key"].IsInt() ) {
    i = v["key"].AsInt();
  }
  else {
    cout << "Error: value is not of the expected type";
  }
\endcode

This release adds a new version of all overloaded AsXxxxxx() function
which stores the value in the provided argument and returns TRUE if the
value stored in the JSON value object is of the correct type.
This is the function prototype for integer value:
\code
  bool AsInt( int& i );
\endcode

Now you can get the value and check if it is of the expected type in 
only one call:

\code
  wxJSONValue v["key"] = 100;
  int i;
  if ( !v["key"].AsInt( i ) ) {
    cout << "Error: value is not of the expected type";
  }
\endcode


\section json_ver11_readwrite The new reader and writer organizaion


Until version 1.0 the \b wxJSON reader and writer had some issues mostly
related to speed. The problem was that both the reader and the writer performed
a character conversion from / to UTF-8 and unicode for every char
read from / written to streams.
Worst, in ANSI builds, every char undergoes to a double conversion for both
the reader and the writer (the following is for the reader):

\li from UTF-8 to \b wchar_t
\li from \b wchar_t to locale dependent \b char

Also note that such a conversion is, for most characters, not needed at all
because those chars are in the US-ASCII charset (0x00..0x7F).

In version 3.0 of the GUI framework, developers have introduced a radical
change to Unicode support and the \b wxString class has totally changed in its
internal organisation.
In particular, the \b wxString class now stores strings in UTF-16 encoding on
Windows and in UTF-8 on unix systems. The drawback is that on *nix systems
the usual character access using subscripts such as:

\code
	wxString s;
	s[n];
\endcode 

is VERY inefficient because of the UTF-8 encoding.
The conseguence is that in wxJSON there is a speed issue also when the JSON
text input is from \b wxString and not only from streams.


\subsection json_ver11_goals What are the goals of the new 1.1 version

In order to find the best organization for the reader and the writer I have to
first point out what are the goals of this new release of wxJSON:

\li compatibility with wxWidgets 2.8 and 2.9

\li compatibility with wxJSON version 1.0: I do not want to break 
	the compatibility with 1.0 version otherwise I will have to change the
	major version number
	
\li speed improvements: I will try to speed-up both the reader and the writer.
	The conversion of \b each character is very slow; there are better
	solutions as pointed out by Piotr Likus in his e-mail of november 2008

\li simplicity: JSON format is very easy to read and write for humans but it is also
	easy for machines to parse and generate. The wxJSON library has to be simple
	in the processing of JSON text.



\subsection json_ver11_solution The new wxJSON organisation

The \b wxJSON library allows you to write / read JSON text 
to / from two different types of objects:

\li a string of type \c wxString
\li a stream of type \c wxInput/OutputStream

These two kinds of I/O classes are very different because of the internal
representation of the JSON text: in particular, wxString uses UTF-16 on windows
and UTF-32 on *nix systems up to \b wxWidgets \b 2.8. UTF-8 is used on *nix systems
in \c wxWidgets \c 2.9. For streams the encoding is alwasy UTF-8.
A further different encoding is used in ANSI mode: locale dependent one-byte characters.

\par Encoding formats in the different wxWidget's modes / versions /platforms

<img src="images/ver11.gif">

These encoding differences complicates very much the organization of the writer
and the reader because character read from / written to JSON text has to be
converted to a unique type for processing. Actually, each char is converted to
a \b wchar_t type and it occurs in ANSI mode, too.
This conversion slows down the processing very much.
A further complication is that \b wxWidgets 2.9 does no more return a \b char
or \b wchar_t type when accessing string objects but a helper class: \b wxUniChar
which has its own encoding format so that it has to be further converted to
\b wchar_t.

The solution is to use only one encoding format for \b all types of I/O, build mode
and wxWidget's versions: UTF-8 is the only one applicable to all these cases.
Using UTF-8 as the unique I/O format has several advantages:

\li UTF-8 does not have endianness or byte order issues

\li the pocessing of characters is \e byte-oriented so there is no need to deal
	with \b wchar_t or \b wxUniChar: special JSON characters, literal and numbers
	lie in the US-ASCII character set (one UTF-8 code unit).

\li the read operation of string values is easy: when a double-quote
	byte is encontered, the UTF-8 stream is simply \b copied to a temporary
	memory buffer until the next unescaped double-quote char (we just process
	escaped chars).
	When the buffer has been read, it is converted in one single step to \b wxString
	using \c wxString::FromUTF8() function.
	
\li the write operation of strings is easy: the \b wxString value is converted
	to a temporary UTF-8 memory buffer using the static \b wxString::ToUTF8()
	function. The bytes are then written to the UTF-8 stream: we only have to
	process control chars and escaped characters.

\li from the point of view of the processing, there is no difference between
	ANSI and Unicode because the processing is byte-oriented.


The only drawback is when input / output is not from / to a stream (which is
in UTF-8 format) but from / to a \b wxString object.
The solution I found is:

\li when input is from a string object, the reader first convert the \b wxString 
	JSON text input in a temporary UTF-8 memory buffer which is used to
	construct a \b wxMemoryInputStream object
	
\li when output is to be sent to a string object, the writer first construct
	a temporary empty \b wxMemoryOutputStream which holds the JSON text output.
	When the write operation is done, the temporary memory buffer is converted
	to a \b wxString object using the \b wxString::FormUTF8() function.
	
So, as opposed to the previous versions, the read / write operations are faster
on streams and slower on strings because of the construction of the temporary UTF-8
memory buffers.
	

\subsection json_ver11_ansiread New feature in ANSI mode

The default behaviour of the \b wxJSON library in ANSI builds when reading from
/ writing to streams is to use UTF-8 encoded text so that the writer produces
valid JSON text and the reader gives some limited Unicode support (see
\ref wxjson_tutorial_unicode_ansi for details).

In version 1.1 I introduced a new feature for ANSI builds: both the reader
and the writer can be constructed with a special flag:

\code
  wxJSONREADER_NOUTF8_STREAM
  wxJSONWRITER_NOUTF8_STREAM
\endcode

that suppress UTF-8 conversion:

\li the writer produces ANSI JSON text which can be correctly read by the
	application that wrote it provided that it is localized in the same locale
\li the reader does not try to convert the JSON text input from UTF-8 because
	it suppose that the text is stored in ANSI format.
	
The advantage of this ANSI mode is speed: string's data is simply copied from
the stream to \b wxString by the reader; JSON values containing string are simply
copied from the \b wxString object to the stream by the writer.

Also note that this feature can be used also if the stream is in UTF-8 format.
By suppressing UTF-8 conversion the reader copies all UTF-8 code units in the
\b wxString object: naturally, the meaning of those code-units are misunderstood
by the wxString object which treats them as locale dependent one-byte characters:
the advantage is that writing them back in ANSI mode just preserve the
UTF-8 encoding because each UTF-8 code-unit is simply \b copied to the stream.
The drawback is that the UTF-8 stream read by the wxJSON reader may contain characters
that \b can be represented in the current locale.
If UTF-8 conversion is disabled in the reader, no conversion takes place.

For example: suppose that in a UTF-8 input stream there is the following string:

\code
  C3 A0 C3 A8 C3 AC C2 A9 C2 AE
\endcode

which has to following meaning (five characters, ten UTF-8 code-units)

\code
  àèì©®
\endcode

The character's meaning could be correcly interpreted in an ANSI application localized in
a Latin-1 charset
If UTF-8 conversion is not disabled, the wxJSON reader reads the five Latin-1 characters correctly.
On the other hand, if UTF-8 conversion is disabled, the ten UTF-8 code-units are simply
copied to the \b wxString object which contains 10 characters whose meaning (in ths ISO-8859-1
charset) is the following:

\code
  Ã Ã¨Ã¬Â©Â®
\endcode
