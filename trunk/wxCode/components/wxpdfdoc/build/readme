wxPdfDocument 0.8.0
===================

When building wxPdfDocument and the sample application with MSVC
please read carefully the following hints:

wxWidgets version
-----------------

While the wxWidgets version for which the component should be compiled
can be set via the option WX_VERSION for makefiles, this doesn't work
for VC project files. You have to edit the version number in the names
of the wxWidgets libraries manually or you could recreate the project
files using bakefile setting explicitly the wxWidgets version number.

Working directory path
----------------------

Since Visual C++ stores working directory path for debugging in
the user preferences and not in the project resp. solution files,
you must set the working directory in the project settings for each
project you intend to run from inside VC++ since the local user
preferences files are not distributed with this component.

DLL builds
----------

If you build wxPdfDocument as a DLL you need to copy the DLL from the
'lib' folder to the 'samples' folder to be able to execute the sample
program. Another solution is to add the 'lib' folder path to the Windows
search path (PATH environment variable).

Bakefile
--------

If you recreate the project and workspace files using bakefile you
should thereafter change the warning level in project settings from
4 to 3, otherwise when compiling the sample application you see lots
of warnings which could be savely ignored.
