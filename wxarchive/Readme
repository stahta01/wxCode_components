Description:
Tar/Pax streams for wxWidgets. This is beta software.

The tar streams are in src/tarstrm.cpp and include/wx/tarstrm.h. You
can include these in your own project (there's no makefile to build
them into a lib).

Currently there is no tar specific docs, however see the docs
about archive classes in general:
http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin_wxarc.html

There is an example program in 'samples/arc.cpp', and a cppunit test
suite in the 'tests' directory.

As well as the tests in the 'tests' directory there is also a
test script 'samples/arctest.sh' which tests the sample program
against zip, pkzip, tar and pax if they are in the path.  By
default it looks for 'arc' in the current directory (so 'cd' to
wherever 'arc' is then run the script).

The script is a Bourne shell script, it can also be run on
Windows using MSYS or Cygwin.

You can create your own makefiles or project files for these, or
alternatively you can generate them using Bakefile (makefiles will be
included in the tarball when this is released).

The instructions for generating and using the makefiles follow. These
makefile are a bit less than perfect right now and might need a little
hand editing in some cases. I'll try and improve them.

Check out the component, e.g.:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode login 
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wxcode co wxCode/components/wxarchive

Bakefile can be obtained from (http://bakefile.sourceforge.net).

Set the WXWIN environment variable to point to your wxWidgets
sources. Then run bakefile_gen from inside the wxCode/components/wxarchive
directory. e.g. on Windows that might be:

    C:\>set WXWIN=C:\wxWidgets
    C:\>cd wxCode\components\wxarchive
    C:\wxCode\components\wxarchive>bakefile_gen

The makefiles also require WXWIN to be set. For the Windows command
line makefiles you can pass WX_UNICODE=1 for a unicode build, and
WX_DEBUG=0 for a release build, e.g. for a unicode build with BCC:

C:\wxCode\components\wxarchive\samples>set WXWIN=C:\wxWidgets
C:\wxCode\components\wxarchive\samples>make -f makefile.bcc WX_UNICODE=1

For a unix system you will also need to generate configure. To
do this you will need aclocal, autoconf and cppunit installed.

First run aclocal, it will need to be able to find wxwin.m4,
bakefile.m4 and cppunit.m4, you can specify locations for these with
the -I option if it can't find them. Next run autoconf, e.g.:

    $ cd wxCode/components/wxarchive
    $ aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal
    $ autoconf

Then an example of running configure and make:

$ ~/wxCode/components/wxarchive/configure --with-wxdir=$HOME/build/gtkud
$ cd tests
$ WXWIN=~/wxWidgets make

In this example the wxWidgets source directory is '~/wxWidgets', and
we are using a GTK+ build of it that is in '$HOME/build/gtkud'.
