\mainpage WebUpdate
<center><em>A powerful and flexible cross-platform update solution<br/>by Francesco Montorsi</em></center>

\section features WebUpdate features
- <b>Open source</b>: wxWidgets-licensed; see http://www.wxwidgets.org/licence.php.

- <b>Cross-platform</b>, using the wxWidgets library; see http://www.wxwidgets.org.

- <b>Ability to update any kind of application</b>: also not wxWidgets-based and not written in C++; see \ref samples.

- <b>Easily integrable in your application</b>: needs only few modifications; see \ref tutorial.

- <b>Small</b>: the binary for win32 distributed at https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=51305&amp;package_id=45182 is about 500 Kb.

- Handles an <b>arbitrary number of packages</b>.

- Allows <b>platform-independent set of installation actions</b> for each package.

- <b>Extensible GUI</b>: it can be modified without recompiling the
application (using the wxWidgets XRC system). This also means that you can
choose among various GUI masks (some are better for simple programs with
few packages, others are better for big programs with many packages) or
just create your own.

- <b>Extensible configuration files</b>: the local & remote XML files (see \ref tutorial
for an explanation of this terminology) allows you to configure the behaviour
of the updater.

- <b>Extensible actions</b>: the actions which are taken when downloading each
package can be chosen by the programmer who writes the remote XML file and
updater allows you to define new actions just deriving a C++ class.
See \ref customaction page.

- <b>Ability to update itself</b>: see \ref updateupdater.

- Optional <b>MD5 checks</b> on the downloaded file to avoid data corruption.

- <b>Ability to download the updates & the remote XML file from any source</b>:
World Wide Web is the typical location but the WebUpdater can be configured
to use the packages stored in any device (CD, DVD, floppies or whatelse).
See the FAQ \ref faq_localupdates.

- Allows many properties to be set for each package: the 'importance', the
platform which it targets, the description, its <b>dependencies on other packages</b>

- The <b>DTD</b>s allows you to easily check your XML files: see \ref localdtd and \ref remotedtd.

- <b>Multilanguage</b> support: currently English, Italian and German.

/*! \page tutorial The WebUpdate tutorial

\section defs Basic WebUpdate concepts
Before using this component, you need to know some few definitions of the terms
used in all WebUpdate documentation:
- the WebUpdate project provides both a library and an executable, which is called
'<strong>WebUpdater</strong>' or just '<strong>updater</strong>'.
The library is used only for some advanced things and for simple programs you will
typically need to use only the 'updater' copying the executable file in your
program's folder. For more info about the design of the WebUpdate component, look at the
\ref faq "FAQ page"...

- a '<b>package</b>' is a set of files which have in common their function (or maybe their
location in the program's folder structure) and are packaged
in a single archive. A 'remote package' is an archive hosted in the webserver for
download. A 'local package' is a package which is installed in the user's system
(typically 'installed' means 'uncompressed').
The C++ classes used by WebUpdate to work on local & remote packages are
wxWebUpdateLocalPackage and wxWebUpdatePackage, respectively.

- a '<b>download</b>' is the compressed file which holds the remote package files.
A single remote package can have many downloads; typically one per targeted platform
even if a single download can be used by more than a single platform.
The C++ class used to store a 'download' is wxWebUpdateDownload.

- an '<b>action</b>' is one of the command to execute after the complete download of a
package (i.e. after the download of the package's 'download' for the current platform).
There are some predefined actions: wxWebUpdateActionRun, wxWebUpdateActionExtract,
wxWebUpdateActionMake, wxWebUpdateActionOpen...
Their base class is wxWebUpdateAction. You can define your own customized actions
deriving a new class from wxWebUpdateAction. For more info about creation of your
custom actions, see \ref customaction page.

- the '<b>local XML script</b>' is the XML file which contains the configuration settings
for the WebUpdater application and also the versions and the list of the local
packages currently installed. The C++ class for local XML scripts is
wxWebUpdateLocalXMLScript.

- the '<b>remote XML script</b>' is slightly more complex rather than the local XML script
because it contains all the info about the remote packages in the webserver
(specially their versions) and the info about their installation.
The C++ class for remote XML scripts is wxWebUpdateXMLScript.

<br/>

\section howto_integrate How to integrate WebUpdate in your application
It's quite easy to use WebUpdate in your programs following these simple steps:

1) <strong>Plan your "update strategies"</strong>: do you need more than a single
package ? Which files will belong to each package ? Which format are you going to
use for your packages: simple archives (ZIP, TAR.GZ, ...) or installers (MSI, RPM,
DEB) ? Which actions will you need to perform such updates ?

Try to keep things as simple as possible; also you should not think to the
action tags as a complete set of installer directives.
In fact, if you need special or platform-dependent actions then you should
use some kind of script in the downloaded file (MSI, RPM, DEB all provide a much
more complete set of possible actions) and then use the WebUpdater just to run
those scripts / installers.

Another thing to consider is: how much often will you make a new release ?
If you often make new releases then you should try to keep the files which need
to be updated separed (i.e. in a different package) from those files which instead
probably won't need updates. In this way the packages which will be downloaded by
the user will be smaller and thus updates will be faster (and the user happier).

On the other hand, if you often make releases or have few time to do the packaging,
and your program is not so big, you should consider to create a single package for
each platform which will work both as installer for the user who downloads your program
for the first time and also as update for the users using WebUpdater.



2) <strong>Write your 'local.xml' file</strong>: this is the simplest XML used
by WebUpdate; it looks like:

\verbinclude local.xml.template

For the complete reference to the tags that you can use in this XML file, you should
look at \ref localdtd
(even if you don't know the DTD syntax it should be quite easy to
understand what is allowed and what is not...).




3) <strong>Write your 'remote.xml' file</strong>: this is a bit more complex and
contains all the important info about the updated packages. It looks like:

\verbinclude remote.xml.template

Like for the local scripts, for the complete reference to the tags that you can
use in this XML file, you should look at \ref remotedtd .



4) <strong>Create your packages</strong>: now, you should create the archives/installers
that you planned to use as update packages. WebUpdate does not require any special hack
to be included in your packages (like the filelist or other ugly things).
It just requires that, if you want to use the \<extract\> action, you use one of the
wxWidgets-supported archive types (look at \ref remotedtd for more info).

After the creation of the packages, you should just upload them in the right places.
Also take in count that while you are testing the update system you can put the packages
in your hard disk and then use in the \<remoteuri\> and \<uri\> tags of the local & remote
XML scripts local URIs (e.g. \<uri\> file:c:/simple.zip \</uri\>) instead of the remote ones;
this allows you to test the update system also when you are offline and, most important,
to test it quickly (since downloads are usually slower than hard disk accesses !).



5) <strong>Modify your program to use WebUpdater</strong>: this is the 'real' integration
step. The changes to your app are very small:
- somewhere (typically in the handler of a menu command) you should put an execute
istruction to run \c "./webupdater" (on unix) or \c "webupdater.exe" (on win32).
You can see how to do this using wxWidgets in the WebUpdate samples.

- just after the call to \c "webupdater(.exe)" you should add an exit istruction; that is,
just after that your program has run the updater, it must also exit.
This is because the updater will probably need to replace your program's executable
or other files locked by your program... and this cannot be done until the program-to-update
is running. See the \ref faq for more info.

Then, just compile WebUpdater (or download its binary distribution)
and put the executable file in your program's root folder. That's it !



5) <strong>Test your update system</strong>: just run your program and see if it
correctly runs the WebUpdater. Once the webupdater is running you should verify
that your application did exit. Then you can test your XML remote script
(the local script is loaded immediately when webupdater starts), the remote
packages and the installation actions just acting as the user of your program would do.



This should be enough to use the WebUpdate component.
For a soft approach you could also prefer to look directly to the samples of WebUpdate.
In this case first look at \ref samples page.

\page samples The samples of WebUpdate

All the samples of WebUpdate comes with at least two different versions.
This is because you need the old version of the sample to test the WebUpdater
and I need the newer version for making the update package ;-)

\note All the version numbers of the samples are completely random.

\note To build the samples, you need to use the same makefiles which build the
      WebUpdater and which are located in \c webupdater/build

<br/>


\section wxsimple The "simple" samples

The "simple" samples in \c samples/simple folder shows you the following:

- the GUI masks of WebUpdater: wxWebUpdateDlg (the most complete one) and wxWebUpdateSimpleDlg.

- how to run WebUpdater from the application to update.

- how to write and use multiple local XML scripts (one per each mask used).

<br/>


\section wxadv The "advanced" samples

The "advanced" samples in \c samples/advanced folder shows you the following:

- multiple packages and inter-packages dependencies

- some more advanced installer actions: \<make\>, \<open\>...

<br/>


\section customact The "custom action" samples

The "custom action" sample in \c samples/customaction folder shows you how to
create a new wxWebUpdateAction-derived for specialized tasks; it's not a "full"
sample since it cannot be compiled but you can still use the files in that folder,
together with the \ref customaction page to implement a sample custom action:
wxWebUpdateActionFontInstall.

\page faq The Frequently Asked Questions about WebUpdate

\section dsg Design of WebUpdate

\subsection faq_exec 1) Why does WebUpdate provides a separate application for handling the update process ? Why I cannot use the provided library and link that to the application to update so that I can ship a single executable ?

   Initially, this WebUpdate project provided only a library and it was designed so that
   the application to update would have linked it and created the update dialog window
   directly. Even if this approach has the advantage of being more compact (a single executable
   file which updates itself) it makes impossible to update the executable and the files it is
   using !

   In fact, while the program is running, its executable file, and eventually any other data file
   which the program has open, are "locked" and thus they cannot be replaced/renamed/deleted.
   This makes this approach unworkable: almost any program needs to update its executable
   file.

   The most used strategy is to keep the program-to-update and the updater separed and this is
   also the approach used by WebUpdate. In this way, when the user clicks the "Update this program"
   link (it can be any type of control; see \ref tutorial) in the program-to-update, the program
   executes asynchronously the WebUpdater application and immediately exits itself.
   So, the program and its data files can be safely updated from WebUpdater since the program-to-update
   is not running. Obviously you then have some problems to update the WebUpdater itself...
   but there is a simple workaround: look at \ref updateupdater.

   The library which is built by WebUpdate sources is only for advanced features
   (see \ref customaction).


\subsection faq_xml 2) Why using XML for the scripts ?

   Why not ? It's easy to parse and human readable. Most important: you don't have to learn
   new syntax rules created ad hoc for WebUpdate.

<br/>


\section usage Using WebUpdate

\subsection faq_hide 1) How can I avoid that the user looks into my local XML file and my XRC file ?

   A simple way to do this is to just rename the files with a different extension and use the
   \c --xml and the \c --xrc WebUpdater options to specify the new file names.
   This is a typical trick which usually keeps naive users away from the application's core
   files; a more secure way, for XRC resources at least, is to convert the XRC file in a compiled
   XRS file using the \c wxrc utility shipped with wxWidgets.

\subsection faq_localupdates 2) How can I use WebUpdate to take the update packages from a non-http resource ?

  You can write your XML local & remote scripts so that WebUpdate will take updates from a non-http resource
  (a local drive/specific folder). In order to do this, you have to modify the \c remoteuri tag content in the
  local XML script using the \c file protocol (e.g. \c file:/usr/local/updates,
  <tt>file:c:/temp/updates</tt> - even on windows, use '/' and not '\\' as path separator).

  In this way the XML remote script can also be placed somewhere \e locally.
  To tell WebUpdate to use local update packages, you should use the \c file protocol also in the
  \c uri tags of the remote XML scripts.

  Last, remember that keyword substitution is performed in all URIs so that you can write
  valid URIs as: <tt>file:$(remotedir)mypackage.msi</tt> or <tt>file:$(localdir)..//..//remote.xml</tt>.

  A typical application of "local updates" is to allow the user to update the program using a removable
  device (CD, DVD, floppy or whatelse). See the \c --ask-uri option in the \ref webupdater page.


\subsection faq_linuxproblem 3) How can I provide binary updates safely for Linux platform ?

  First of all, since there are so many Linux distributions out there and building a distro-neutral
  binary is not easy, I suggest you to use the <tt>platform</tt> tag in the remote XML scripts to
  be able to limitate the update support only to those platforms where you know that your binary runs fine.

  Second, I suggest you to look at the <b>Autopackage project</b>: http://www.autopackage.org.
  It contains variuos tools which help you to reduce the dependencies of your ELF thus making a lot
  easier the creation of distro-neutral binaries for Linux.
  
  Autopackage is also linked to the LUAU (http://luau.sourceforge.net) project which have similar
  aims to WebUpdate but for Linux-only. If you want to release your software for Linux only, or you
  want to provide update support only there, then I suggest you to take a look at it.

\page webupdater WebUpdater application reference

The WebUpdater application accepts some command line options which can be very useful:
you can get this list using the "--help" option.

\li \c --xml=mypath/mylocal.xml: by default, WebUpdater searches for a local XML configuration
    file called "local.xml" in its same folder; with this option you can override this default
    and specify both the path and the filename of the local XML file to load.

\li \c --xrc=mypath/myxrc.xrc: by default, WebUpdater searches for an XRC file
    called "webupdatedlg.xrc" in its same folder; with this option you can override this default
    and specify both the path and the filename of the XRC file to load.
    Note that this is not the only way to customize the GUI mask of WebUpdater: in the local
    XML file you can also use the \<dlgxrc\> tag to specify the name of the resource to use
    from the XRC file which is loaded.

\li \c --uri=http://myserver.com/remote.xml: allows you to specify the URI used to
    load the remote XML script. Note that you *must* specify this URI either through this
    option or through the \<remoteuri\> tag in the local XML script and that this option
    has precedence over the \<remoteuri\> tag.<br/>
    If you use this option, you cannot use also \c --ask-uri.

\li \c --ask-uri=path/name_of_remote_xml.xml: tells WebUpdater to ask to the user to select a local
    folder (can be the drive of a removable device, too) where the remote XML script is placed.
    Until the user selects a folder which contains a file named \c "name_of_remote_xml.xml"
    (i.e. the argument given to the \c --ask-uri option) the WebUpdater won't proceed.
    The default path shown to the user in the directory selector dialog is the \c path of the
    argument of the option.<br/>
    If you use this option, you cannot use also \c --uri.

\li \c --restart: tell WebUpdater to restart the updated application after update process
    is complete. Note that this option will set as initially checked the relative checkbox
    in the wxWebUpdateAdvPanel XRC default resource but the user will still be able to
    uncheck it and thus avoid that the updated application is restarted.
    To make it impossible for the user to restart the application, you should remove that
    checkbox from the wxWebUpdateAdvPanel resource of \c webupdatedlg.xrc.

\li \c --savelog: tell WebUpdater to save a log file (called by default \c webupdater.log)
    with some diagnostic messages which are useful to discover eventual bugs.

*/



/*!

\page updateupdater How to update the WebUpdater

First, look at \ref faq and in particular to the first question in design section.
As you can understand, there's no good (i.e. reliable & cross-platform) to replace
the executable file of a running program.
So, WebUpdater is a program separed from the application-to-update. This makes it easy
to update the application-to-update but what about the WebUpdater itself ?
How can it be updated, in case a new version is released ?

The answer is: using the \<extract\> action and a little trick in the application-to-update.
If you look at the \ref remotedtd you will note in the \<extract\> action tag documentation
that when extracting files from compressed archives, it always extracts the files named
\c "webupdater.exe" (on win32) or \c "webupdater" (on unix) as \c "_webupdater.exe" (on win32)
or \c "_webupdater" (on unix).

The final replacement takes place when the application-to-update runs again: infact it should
include a check just after initialization for the existence of a \c "_webupdater(.exe)" file.
If such file is found, then it means that during the last update, a newer version of the WebUpdater
has been downloaded: the application just needs to remove the old \c "webupdater(.exe)" file and
then rename the \c "_webupdater(.exe)" file into \c "webupdater(.exe)".

That's it: an easy and reliable way to update the updater.
You can found the wxWidgets-based code that does the check for the \c "_webupdater(.exe)" file,
in a cross-platform way, in the \c advanced sample.

/*!

\page customaction How to create a new custom action

This document describes how to add a "mod" to WebUpdate so that it recognizes a new
action tag. Note that you should first consider accurately:

- the standard actions: wxWebUpdateActionRun, wxWebUpdateActionCopy, wxWebUpdateActionMake,
  wxWebUpdateActionOpen. They are designed to be as flexible as possible (e.g. the 'copy'
  action can also be used as 'move' action; make can be used to create files or folders.. etc)
  and thus they cover a wide range of common needs.

- other solutions like using an installer (.MSI, .DEB, .RPM) which provides a much more complete
  set of possible installation steps and platform-specific actions.

<br/>

\section required Required libraries & utilities for making a WebUpdate mod

If you want to make a MOD (i.e. a "modification") to WebUpdate, then you need the following
libraries installed in your system:

- wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org): WebUpdate is entirely based on this great cross-platform
  GUI toolkit so you cannot avoid this dependency

- wxHttpEngine (http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/showcomp.php?name=wxHttpEngine): if you want to
  compile WebUpdater with proxy & HTTP authentication support, you need this library and then
  you need to use the \c USE_HTTPENGINE=1 (on win32) or \c --with-httpengine (on unix) option
  when compiling WebUpdater (see WebUpdate Readme for more info)

and also the following tools:

- a compiler (obviously!)

- Bakefile (http://bakefile.sourceforge.net): this is the makefile-generator used by WebUpdate
  and is required by step #2.

After you have installed these, you're ready to go !

<br/>

\section step1 Step #1: Writing your wxWebUpdateAction-derived class

Create the header file and the source file for your new action: you can see a new sample
custom action in \c samples/customaction/fontinstall.*; these files also are a good
start point for writing the implementation of your own action.

As you can see from \c samples/customaction/fontinstall.h, your action class definition will
look like:

\code
class WXDLLIMPEXP_WEBUPDATE MyAction : public wxWebUpdateAction
{
	DECLARE_WEBUPDATEACTION(MyAction, wxT("tagname"))

protected:		// here go the declarations of the variables used by this action

	// Holds the content of the first property of this action
	wxString m_strFirstProperty;

	...
};
\endcode

Obviously instead of \c "tagname" you should put the name of the XML tag which will
be handled by your action (choose a lowercase name which does not contain blank characters).

You won't need to declare any constructor/destructor using the \c DECLARE_WEBUPDATEACTION
macro defined in \c stdactions.h.


The implementation of your class requires you to write only two functions which will be called
by the WebUpdate installer:

- wxWebUpdateAction::Run()
- wxWebUpdateAction::SetProperties()

follow the links for more info about these functions.

<br/>



\section step2 Step #2: Creating your "modded" WebUpdate

Now, create a \c mod.bkl file like the one in the \c samples/customaction folder; for a more
complete list of options that you can use in your \c mod.bkl, see \c build/mod.bkl.template.

The list of source & header files which you write in your \c mod.bkl will be compiled together
with WebUpdate and will become part of the updater.

Now, you just need to put the files that you created in the right folders:

- move the source files in the \c webupdate/src folder;
- move the header files in the \c webupdate/include/wx folder;
- move the \c mod.bkl file in the \c webupdate/build folder;

Ok; now run the "bakefile_gen" utility in the \c webupdate/build folder to regenerate
the makefiles of WebUpdate. If you get errors from the \c bakefile_gen command, then check your
\c mod.bkl file: all the others BKL files of WebUpdate should be working ;)

Last step: compile the modded WebUpdate. In order to do this, you need to look to the WebUpdate
ReadMe file.

<br/>


\section step3 Conclusion

Some advices:
- if you want to make WebUpdater as small as possible, you should use the \c WX_DEBUG=0 (on win32)
  or \c --disable-debug (on unix) option. On Win32 I strongly advise you to use the UPX compressor
  (see http://upx.sourceforge.net) to cut the size of the EXE by more than 50%.

- if you think that others could benefit from your wxWebUpdateAction-derived class, and also
  these conditions are met:
  \li you agree to use wxWidgets license for your wxWebUpdateAction-derived class
  \li your action implementation is cross-platform
  then, please submit your code to the author ("frm AT users.sourceforge.net"); I will be pleased
  to include your code in the next WebUpdate release.


- if you need to share some of your application's code with your wxWebUpdateAction-derived class,
  then you can copy together with your class implementation files also your application's sources
  and add them to your \c mod.bkl
